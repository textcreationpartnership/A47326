            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <head>To my Ever Honoured and very Good Lady, the Lady <hi>Dawes</hi> of <hi>Putney.</hi>
            </head>
            <opener>
               <salute>Madam,</salute>
            </opener>
            <p>THere are many Books alrea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy extant upon the Argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment which the following Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſe treats of: And thoſe alſo ſo very good in themſelves, and ſo very happy in their Authors, that
<pb facs="tcp:59207:3"/>I cannot think that this which fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lows, will ever deſerve a name a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongſt them. For as it was at firſt drawn up for thoſe whoſe needs re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quired all plainneſs of ſpeech; ſo it now adventures abroad in the ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry ſame dreſs in which it was at firſt compoſed and delivered. And therefore I might well find great reaſon to diſpute with my ſelf whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther or not I ſhould adventure this Diſcourſe abroad.</p>
            <p>But whatever demur theſe things might make, yet ſure I am, I did not doubt to whom I ought to addreſs it, when I was once reſol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved to make it publick. 'Tis due to you, Madam, whatever it is, up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on more ſcores than one. And though it be unworthy of ſo good a name, as it will now bear; yet I am certain that it needs it.</p>
            <p>
               <pb facs="tcp:59207:3"/>I ſhall not need to recommend to your Ladiſhip the ſubject of this following Tract. You are alrea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy greatly in love with that part of your duty which is here diſcourſed of. You are firmly reſolved to lead a life of Religion, and to give up your ſelf to the obedience of the Laws of your Lord and Saviour. Now certainly you will find no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing a greater help to you than frequent and devout Communions are. You will find great need in your pilgrimage towards Heaven of ſuch Spiritual repaſts and viands. Nothing can be more welcome to a pious Soul than to meet with theſe happy opportunities of be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>coming better. And they that love their Lord muſt needs be very for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward to celebrate the memory of his death, and unſpeakable kind<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs to them. The doing of this
<pb facs="tcp:59207:4"/>as we ought, will redound greatly to our advantage. We ſhall by this means be reconciled to God, and in perfect charity to one ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther: We ſhall be more fit to live, and more prepared to die: We ſhall the better ſupport under our ſorrows, and be the more ſtrong againſt our temptations; our bur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den will be the lighter, and yet our ſtrength the greater: We ſhall here receive new ſtrength and vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gor to walk in Gods ways: We ſhall think that eaſie which once we thought intolerable: We ſhall lead at once an innocent and an uſeful life. The advantages of frequent and devout Communions are not to be expreſſed. Here are joys which no man can rob us of; Treaſures more valuable than that of the <hi>Indies.</hi> Every pious Soul will witneſs to this truth. And
<pb facs="tcp:59207:4"/>therefore, Madam, I doubt not but you will the more favourably receive this treatiſe for the argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments ſake which it diſcourſeth of.</p>
            <p>But ſtill, Madam, I have farther reaſon upon my own account to make my acknowledgements to your Ladiſhip. Your kindneſſes to me have been very great, and have laid a great obligation upon me to ſhew my thankfulneſs to you. And as an unfained teſtimony of my gratitude I am bold to preſent you with this Diſcourſe. It is in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed but a ſmall tribute of thanks, which here I pay you; but yet is ſuch as I have, and your Ladiſhip will I hope, rather regard my mind than the thing it ſelf. How<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever I ſhall be extreamly glad if any thing that is here offered may be of any uſe to your Ladiſhip in advancing your eternal intereſt and concern.</p>
            <p>
               <pb facs="tcp:59207:5"/>You have made a good begin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning, and a wiſe Choice in devot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing your ſelf to a Religious Life. Continue, Madam, in this purpoſe. This will turn to your account when all other things will fail you. There was never greater need of regular and exemplary piety than now. Religion is now become the ſcoff and deriſion of profane and fooliſh men. It is not now the mode to be ſeverely Pious. Pure Religion and undefiled is very rare<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly to be found. It is infinitely ſad to think that ſo excellent a Religion as ours is, ſhould be almoſt every where, either miſunderſtood, or ſpoken againſt. Your Conſtancy now will be more rewardable than at other times. You will now ſee cauſe to ſhew a great regard to the Laws of your deareſt Lord, when they are ſo commonly trampled
<pb facs="tcp:59207:5"/>upon. Count it your honour to be truly good. And dare to own your Saviour before men, and he will confeſs you before his Heaven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly Father.</p>
            <p>We are concerned to refute the Atheiſts, and to defend the excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent Religion which our Lord hath left us againſt gain-ſayers. But there is not a more effectual way of doing this than by an exemplary and pious life. This does more than our moſt ſubtile and nervous reaſoning, a great example of Piety does more good than a learned Pen. This is the moſt likely way to pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vail againſt thoſe that oppoſe them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves. Our enemies mouths are ſtop'd if we take this courſe: Theſe Arguments are unanſwerable, and will convert more to the Faith than our Reaſons are like to do. Now, Madam, you can thus defend your
<pb facs="tcp:59207:6"/>Religion againſt contentious men. This is the way to reſtore us to what we ſhould be.</p>
            <p>I have great reaſon to believe that your Ladiſhip will be a great ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ample of real piety. That you will ſtrongly purſue every vertuous and good thing. But yet, Madam, you will pardon me that I put you in mind to perſevere and to abound in every good thing. This proceeds not from any diſtruſt, but from a great and ſincere deſire of your happineſs. That the Almighty would keep your Ladiſhip from every evil thing, and bleſs you with all the bleſſings of this and a better Life, is the moſt hearty prayer of,</p>

            <head>The PREFACE.</head>
            <p>HOW plain a Precept we have to partake of our Lords Supper; and how much it would be for our advantage to do it; I ſhall not need to repreſent to the Reader in this place. That is done in the following Diſcourſe. And all that I ſhall here trouble the Reader with, is;</p>
            <p>First, that he would be pleaſed to under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtand that this Diſcourſe was by the Author deſigned for the uſe of thoſe men who stand in need of the most plain and eaſie directions: And therefore it is accordingly fitted for ſuch men who have not either the leiſure, or the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther advantages of peruſing the more large and elaborate Diſcourſes upon this Subject.</p>
            <p>Secondly, that the Authors lot is fallen among thoſe who do very rarely partake of this Sacrament, and that therefore he does the more inſiſt upon the neceſſity of the duty, as well as upon little objections which are brought againſt it, which are ſo ſmall that they might otherwiſe have been prudently omitted. But ſo it is now that we are put upon the proof of thoſe things which our fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fathers did not deny. And we have now a double task upon us: To prove the truth of our Religion firſt, and then to perſwade to
<pb facs="tcp:59207:7"/>the practice of it. It might otherwiſe ſeem a ſtrange thing that any man ſhould be operoſe in proving that it is our duty to partake of this Sacrament, when the command for it is ſo plain.</p>
            <p>I have this moreover to deſire of the Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der, that he would (when he reads this Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſe) be careful to lay aſide all prejudice. It will be no hard matter to find the truth, in the caſe here diſcourſed of, if we ſeek it ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerely. The good God open our eyes, and lead us at once into the paths of truth and peace: And grant that we may be reconciled to him, and to one another.</p>
            <p>I have nothing farther to beg of the pious and Christian Reader, but this one requeſt, that he would pray to God for the Author, that his labours may not always be in vain.</p>

            <head>A plain and familiar DISCOURSE Concerning the LORDS SUPPER; SHEWING At once the Nature of that Sacrament, as alſo the right way of preparing our ſelves for the receiving of it.</head>

                  <hi>CHAP. I.</hi> The Nature and true Notion of this Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment.</head>
               <p>IT is my intention in this following Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſe, not to trouble my Reader with Queſtions and Controverſies a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout the Sacrament of our Lords Sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per (of which there are too many in the World already) but to direct him how he
<pb n="2" facs="tcp:59207:10"/>may partake worthily, as well as ſhew him the danger in not partaking at all. And for the better gaining of the firſt of theſe ends, I think it neceſſary to premiſe ſomething of the nature, and true notion of this Sacrament of the Lords Supper: That ſo we may perform a <hi>reaſonable ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice,</hi> and not give <hi>the Sacrifice of Fools, who conſider not that they do evil,</hi> Eccleſ. 5.1. And that we may not <hi>eat and drink damnation to our ſelves, not diſcerning the Lords Body,</hi> 1 Cor. 11.29.</p>
               <p>Now for the better underſtanding the nature of this Sacrament, it will be neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſary the great ends and purpoſes for which it was ordained by our Bleſſed Saviour, ſhould be duly conſidered.</p>
               <p>Now the ends of this Sacrament of the Lords Supper are theſe that follow.</p>
               <p n="1">I. The renewal of that Covenant which we entered into in our Baptiſm. The Vow which we made in our Baptiſm we ought very ſeriouſly to reflect upon. By our Baptiſm we were received into the Family and Church of Chriſt; and by the Vow which we then made, we are obliged to obey all the commands of Chriſt. What the Apoſtle ſays of Circumciſion, I may truly ſay of Baptiſm, <hi>I teſtifie to every man,</hi>
                  <pb n="3" facs="tcp:59207:10"/>ſays he, <hi>that is Circumciſed, that he is a deb<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tor to the whole Law,</hi> Gal. 5.3. And by the ſame reaſon every man that is Baptized is obliged to obey all the Precepts of the Goſpel.<note place="margin">
                     <gap reason="foreign">
                        <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                     </gap>. Theophyl. in loc.</note> The ſame Apoſtle tells us, <hi>That they that have been Baptized into Chriſt have put on Christ,</hi> Gal. 3.27. That is ſurely, they are ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liged to be as he was; to be that by <hi>grace</hi> which he was by <hi>nature;</hi> to bear his <hi>image</hi> into whoſe <hi>name</hi> they are Baptized. In Baptiſm we gave up our names to Chriſt, and by that <hi>Sacrament</hi> liſted our ſelves un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der him as the only Captain of our Salva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion; we acknowledged him in all his Offices, not only as our <hi>Prieſt,</hi> but as our only <hi>Prophet,</hi> and our <hi>King:</hi> And did not only profeſs a belief of the Chriſtian Faith, but ſolemnly promiſe Obedience to the commands of God in oppoſition to the Devil, the World and Fleſh: This we did when we were Baptized, we made a moſt ſolemn vow to become the Servants of Chriſt, and did receive a Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment upon it;<note place="margin">Budaeus in Pandect.</note> As amongſt the <hi>Romans,</hi> the Soldiers that were liſted took and Oath which was called <hi>a Sacrament of Fidelity,</hi> after which they
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:59207:11"/>could not revolt without a great ſhame, and making themſelves liable to the ſeve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reſt penalty: So have we done, we have taken this <hi>Sacrament of Fidelity,</hi> and by that, have moſt ſolemnly obliged our ſelves to be the faithful Servants and Soldiers of Chriſt unto our lives end. So that I may well tell the man that is Baptized,<note place="margin">Quod maximum vin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culum eſt ad bonam mentem, promiſiſtivi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rum bonum. Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mento rogatus es. <hi>Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nec. Ep. 37.</hi>
                  </note> that he is faſt bound, and obliged to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come a good man by his own promiſe, and Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of fidelity. But then becauſe our infirmities are many, and we are apt to forget our promiſe to God; and becauſe Gods mercies are great, and he is not willing we ſhould periſh, he hath ordained another Sacrament that we might not want a bleſſed opportunity to <hi>bewail</hi> our <hi>back-ſlidings,</hi> and to <hi>renew</hi> our <hi>Covenant.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Gods Mercy is ſo great, that he does not only bring us into his Family by Bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſm, but feed and preſerve us there by this Sacrament of our Lords Supper. He would have us ſaved, and therefore hath ordained this Sacrament, that we might be put upon a moſt ſerious Repentance for our paſt ſins, and effectual purpoſes of a
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:59207:11"/>new life, for the time to come. God would have us faſten the firſt bond with a more firm and ſure knot. Our Souls are like Clocks or Watches, which though they be ſet right, and wound up, yet ſtand in need quickly of being ſet right, and wound up again. This is that graci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous opportunity that God hath given us, of ſetting all things right, and amending the great diſorders of our ſouls. We are now to renew that Covenant which we made in Baptiſm; which becauſe we have failed in, God hath ordained this Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment to reſtore us, and ſet us right: We are now to <hi>lift up the hands which hang down, and the feeble knees: And make straight paths for our feet, leſt that which is lame be turned out of the way, but that it may rather be healed.</hi> Now that this ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crament was ordained for this end that we might renew our Covenant, which we made with God in Baptiſm, will appear, if we conſider the following ſeverals.</p>
               <p n="1">(1.) The very eating and drinking at Gods Table is a faederal rite; they that eat together are ſuppoſed to be Friends. It was a token of friendſhip of old, as the Scriptures will teach us; <hi>Mine own fami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liar
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:59207:12"/>friend in whom I truſted, which did eat of my bread, hath lift up his heel againſt me,</hi> Pſal. 41.9. And thus <hi>the men of thy peace,</hi> and <hi>of thy bread,</hi> are the ſame with <hi>confe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derates,</hi> Obad. v. 7. vid. verſ. <hi>Syriac</hi> in <hi>locum.</hi> When the Relatives of <hi>Job,</hi> who had kept from him during his affliction, came to renew their friendſhip, and ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſs their kindneſs to him; the Text ſays, <hi>They did eat bread with him in his houſe,</hi> Job 42.11. And certainly it was a ſign of great kindneſs among the Children of <hi>Job,</hi> that his <hi>Sons feaſted in their houſes, and called for their ſisters to eat and drink with them,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Diogen. Laert. in vit. Pythag. &amp; Greg. Gyrald. in Pythag. Symbol.</note> Job 1.4. It is a known Precept of <hi>Pythagoras;</hi> that we ſhould not <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>, that we ſhould not break off our friendſhip, which by eat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Bread together we made a ſhew of. For that is ſuppoſed to be his meaning, when he requires that we ſhould not break or divide the Bread of Friends, that we ſhould not <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>. That we ſhould not ſeparate and divide that bond of kindneſs which holds friends together. But eating Bread together was not only alwayes eſteemed a token of kindneſs and friendſhip, and confederacy, but it was
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:59207:12"/>alſo anciently a rite that was uſed when men made or renewed a Covenant with one another. This will alſo appear from the Holy Scriptures, when the <hi>Gibeonites</hi> came to make a League with <hi>Iſrael,</hi> they brought <hi>Bread</hi> with them as well as <hi>bottles</hi> of <hi>Wine:</hi> The Bread they brought ſeem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to be deſigned for their Covenant, which they intended to make with the men of <hi>Iſrael,</hi> of whom it is ſaid, that when they conſented to their demands, that <hi>they took of their Victuals, and asked not Counſel at the Mouth of the Lord,</hi> Joſh. 9.14. That is, they made a Covenant with them, and did not firſt ask counſel of God; for certainly thoſe words <hi>they took of their victuals,</hi> can have no other ſenſe in this place. And ſo the <hi>Chaldee</hi> Paraphraſt ſeems to underſtand them,<note place="margin">
                     <gap reason="foreign">
                        <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                     </gap>
                  </note> for he renders them thus, <hi>They hearkened unto their words:</hi> i. e. They conſented to en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter into Covenant with the <hi>Gibeonites,</hi> and in token of that, they took of their Vic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuals, which was a ſign of their friendſhip to them.<note place="margin">
                     <hi>Kimchi in</hi> Joſh. 9.14.</note> So that the <hi>Gibeonites</hi> might be confident now that they were received into favour, becauſe the <hi>Iſraelites</hi> had taken of their
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:59207:13"/>victuals, and had by that Ceremony de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clared themſelves willing to make a League with them: And it follows immediately upon this that <hi>Joſhua made peace with them, and made a league with them, &amp;c.</hi> v. 15. So that it ſeems to be very plain, that thoſe words, <hi>they took of their victuals,</hi> do im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>port no leſs, than that the <hi>Iſraelites</hi> yield<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to the requeſt of the Men of <hi>Gibeon,</hi> and intended to take them into favour: And the <hi>Giheonites</hi> might as well conclude ſo much from their ſo doing; as the Wife of <hi>Manoah</hi> did infer Gods favour to be towards her and her Husband, becauſe he had received their burnt-offering, and their meat-offering; <hi>If</hi> (ſays ſhe) <hi>the Lord were pleaſed to kill us, he would not have re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived a burnt-offering, and a meat-offering at our hands,</hi> Judg. 13.23.</p>
               <p>Again, when <hi>Iſaac</hi> makes a Covenant with <hi>Abimelech,</hi> the Text tells us, that he <hi>made a feaſt, and they did eat and drink:</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Abravenel in loc. Fol. <hi>93.</hi> Col. <hi>3.</hi>
                  </note> And then it is preſently added, <hi>that they ſware one to another,</hi> Gen. 26.30, 31. And when <hi>Jacob</hi> makes a Covenant with <hi>La<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ban,</hi> it is expreſly ſaid, that he <hi>called his brethren to eat bread,</hi> Gen. 31.54. Eating of Bread together was ſo ſure a ſign of
<pb n="9" facs="tcp:59207:13"/>accord, and a mutual kindneſs, that when <hi>Iſhmael,</hi> with the men that were with him, came to <hi>Mizpah</hi> with an intention to kill <hi>Gedaliah,</hi> that they might not be ſuſpected of any ſuch deſign, <hi>they did eat bread with him in Mizpah,</hi> Jer. 41.2.</p>
               <p>And as eating together was a federal rite, and a token of kindneſs and friend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip, ſo not vouchſafing to eat together, hath been alſo taken for an argument of eſtrangedneſs, and a great difference. Thus we read that the <hi>Egyptians might not eat bread with the Hebrews; for that is an abo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mination to the Egyptians,</hi> Gen. 43.32. And the Apoſtle, when he would have the ſincere Chriſtian not ſo much as to countenance the debaucht and lewd Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſor of Religion, he will not permit him ſo much as <hi>to eat</hi> with him, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 5.11.</p>
               <p>By what hath been ſaid it does appear, that eating and drinking together hath been a mark of kindneſs, and hath been uſed when Covenants and Agreements have been made between men. Now when we partake of the Lords Supper we have fellowſhip with God himſelf, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 10.20, 21. We eat at his Table, and do become his gueſts. But becauſe we can have no fellowſhip with him when we
<pb n="10" facs="tcp:59207:14"/>walk in darkneſs, (1 <hi>Joh.</hi> 1.6.) therefore we cannot partake aright of this Supper of our Lord, unleſs we put away the evil of our doings, unleſs we put on the Wed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding-Garment, and renew that Covenant which we did once make with God, and which we have ſo greatly broken.</p>
               <p n="2">(2.) That this Sacrament was ordained for a renewal of our Covenant with God, appears from the words of our Saviour, when he did firſt inſtitute and appoint it. When he gave his Diſciples the Cup, he adds, <hi>This is my blood of the New Teſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment</hi> (or Covenant as that word ſignifies) <hi>which is ſhed for many, for the remiſſion of ſins,</hi> Mat. 26.28. For the better under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding of which words, we may remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber that it was an antient cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtom in the World,<note place="margin">Tacit. Annal. l. <hi>12.</hi>
                  </note> when men entered into Covenant with one another, that they did it by ſhedding of Blood; they did ſlay a beaſt and pour out its Blood, and thus they did <hi>ferire faedu<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>,</hi> ſtrike a Covenant with one ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther. In token I ſuppoſe, that he that ſhould fail of performing his part of the Covenant which they entered into, ſhould periſh as the beaſt did which was ſlain be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
<pb n="11" facs="tcp:59207:14"/>them. Nor was this a cuſtom a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong the <hi>Gentiles</hi> only, but alſo a cuſtom that God made uſe of among the <hi>Jews</hi> his own people. For ſo we read, that when God gave his Law to that people, and that Law had been read in the audience of the people, and the people had promiſed obedience to that Law, that they entered into Covenant by blood: For it is added, that <hi>Moſes took the blood and ſprinkled it on the people, and ſaid, behold the Blood of the Covenant, which the Lord hath made with you concerning all theſe words,</hi> Exod. 24.8. This was the blood of that Covenant which God made with that people. To theſe words our Saviour may be thought to al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lude, when he was ready to lay down his Life, and ſhed his Blood for our Remiſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, he gives his Diſciples the Cup, and tells them, <hi>This is my Blood of the New Covenant, which is ſhed for many for the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſion of ſins.</hi> That blood which <hi>Moſes</hi> ſprinkled was the blood of <hi>beaſts,</hi> but this is the blood of <hi>Jeſus;</hi> that was the blood of a <hi>Covenant,</hi> but of the <hi>old,</hi> but this is the blood of the <hi>new</hi> and better <hi>Covenant:</hi> That was ſhed for the <hi>Jews</hi> only, but this is ſhed for <hi>many,</hi> for <hi>Jew</hi> and <hi>Gentile,</hi> for all that believe. The blood of the Law
<pb n="12" facs="tcp:59207:15"/>of <hi>Moſes</hi> did not expiate for <hi>all ſins,</hi> but this blood is ſhed for the <hi>Remiſſion of ſins,</hi> yea of thoſe ſins which could not be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted by the Laws of <hi>Moſes.</hi> For by Jeſus we have the forgiveneſs of ſins; <hi>and by him all that believe are juſtified from all things, from which they could not be juſtified by the law of Moſes,</hi> Act. 13.39.</p>
               <p>So that as the Blood which <hi>Moſes</hi> ſprinkled, was the blood of that Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant which the <hi>Jews</hi> entered into, ſo is the blood of Jeſus which he ſhed for us, the blood of the New Covenant; and he that drinks of this blood renews his Covenant, and doth moſt ſolemnly take upon himſelf the obſervation of the Lawes of Chriſt. When <hi>Moſes</hi> had read the Law to the people, and they had promiſed Obedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence, then does he ſprinkle them with the blood of the Covenant, and by that fede<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral rite they are received into Covenant with God. And ſo when our Bleſſed Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viour had taught his Diſciples the will of his Heavenly Father, and was ready to ſhed his blood for our remiſſion, he or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dains this Sacrament of his blood, which when we do partake of as we ſhould, lays a ſtrict obligation upon us to obedience of the Laws of God which are made known
<pb n="13" facs="tcp:59207:15"/>to us in the Goſpel. When we drink of this Cup we renew our Covenant with God, and do moſt ſolemnly bind our ſelves to a faithful and ſincere Obedience; we do as it were take a Sacramental Oath of Allegiance; and if we be treacherous and falſe, we are perjured perſons, and make our ſelves guilty of the blood of Jeſus.</p>
               <p n="2">II. Another end of this Sacrament is, that we ſhould remember the love of our Lord Jeſus Chriſt in laying down his life for us. <hi>This do in remembrance of me,</hi> Luk. 22.19. <hi>As often as ye eat this bread, and drink this cup, ye do ſhew the Lords death till he come,</hi> 1 Cor. 11.26. The <hi>Jewiſh</hi> Paſſover was appointed for a <hi>memorial</hi> of their deliverance out of <hi>Egypt,</hi> Exod. 12.14. And this Chriſtian Paſſover was inſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuted for a <hi>memorial,</hi> but of a greater de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liverance than from the bondage of <hi>Egypt,</hi> of our Redemption from ſin and death. So great a mercy as the deliverance out of <hi>Egypt</hi> might not be forgotten, much leſs may this Redemption which our Lord hath wrought. And as the Paſſover was com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded that they might not forget their freedom from <hi>Egypt,</hi> ſo is this Sacrament appointed that we might never forget a
<pb n="14" facs="tcp:59207:16"/>greater freedom which our Lord hath pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chaſed for us from the tyranny of ſin, and the bitterneſs of death. There was a <hi>mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy</hi> in <hi>that</hi> deliverance, but in <hi>this</hi> a <hi>miracle of mercy:</hi> God in that ſhewed his <hi>love</hi> to his people, but in this there are all the <hi>di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>menſions of love;</hi> here's <hi>breadth,</hi> and <hi>length,</hi> and <hi>depth,</hi> and <hi>height,</hi> here's <hi>a love which paſſeth knowledge,</hi> Eph. 3.18, 19. <hi>Greater love hath no man than this, that a man lay down his life for his friends,</hi> Joh. 15.13. But our Saviours love hath out-ſtript this, and exceeded it greatly, for he died for his enemies. And <hi>God commendeth his love towards us in that while we were yet ſinners, Chriſt dyed for us,</hi> Rom. 5.8, Our Books tell us many ſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries of the great love that one friend hath ſhewed another,<note place="margin">Lucian. Toxar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeu de Amicitia.</note> but none of them tell us of ſuch a kindneſs to enemies, as what our Saviour ſhewed in his Death. Here's a love that out-ſtrips not only all the Laws, but all the examples of friend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip; nay, a love that ſurpaſſes the love of Women. Our Saviour became <hi>poor</hi> that we might be <hi>rich;</hi> he <hi>died</hi> that we might <hi>live,</hi> he became a <hi>ſon</hi> of <hi>man,</hi> that we might be made the <hi>ſons</hi> of <hi>God,</hi> and left his <hi>glory</hi> that he might ſhew us the <hi>way

               <p>So great a ſalvation hath our Saviour wrought for us; ſo great a love hath he ſhewed in laying down his life for us, that it ought never to be forgotten as long as
<pb n="17" facs="tcp:59207:17"/>the World endures. And that it might never be forgotten, our Saviour hath ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointed the Sacrament of the Lords Sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per to be a ſtanding memorial of his great love in dying for us. <hi>Do this,</hi> ſays he, <hi>in remembrance of me.</hi> We are indeed ready to receive mercies, and alſo very ready to forget that they are beſtowed up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on us. And therefore God hath taken this care that we might never forget them. He did ſo with the <hi>Jews,</hi> who were a ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry unthankful people, and very prone to forget him that had done ſo many kind<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſes for them. Leſt that people ſhould forget their <hi>Creator,</hi> God appointed the <hi>Sabbath-day</hi> to be obſerved in memory of the <hi>Creation</hi> of the World, <hi>Exod.</hi> 20.11. When he brought the <hi>Iſraelites</hi> out of <hi>E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gypt,</hi> he ordains the <hi>Paſse-over</hi> in memo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry of that deliverance, <hi>Exod.</hi> 12. And beſides that, he obliges them ſeverely to obſerve that feaſt, and frequently by his ſervants puts them in mind of that delive<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance, and over and above appoints the Sabbath-day alſo (which was at firſt com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded upon another ſcore) as a weekly remembrancer of that great deliverance, <hi>Deut.</hi> 5.15. But he that delivered them out of <hi>Egypt</hi> did alſo carry them through the Wilderneſs, and in <hi>memory</hi> of
<pb n="18" facs="tcp:59207:18"/>that mercy in redeeming them from the <hi>travels</hi> and <hi>pilgrimage of the deſert,</hi> he ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>points an Anniverſary feaſt, <hi>viz.</hi> the <hi>feast of Tabernacles,</hi> Lev. 23.43. Other Feſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vals there were, and divers memorials of the mercies of God ſhewed to that peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, and to their fathers. They who were ſo apt to forget Gods mercies were pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vided with ſuch ſervices as ſhould put them fairly in mind of them. God hath done thus mercifully with us alſo; He hath not only given his Son to die for us (than which there cannot be a greater mercy) but he hath ordained this Sacrament as a perpetual memorial of ſo great a love.</p>
               <p>And as among the <hi>Jews</hi> thoſe ſervices which God required were very proper re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>membrancers and monitors of the mercies they had received, ſo it is in the caſe that is before us. Their Sabbath which did ſucceed their ſix days labour put them in mind of Gods creating the World, and ceaſing from thoſe works. Their Paſs-over brought to their mind the mercies of God in their Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demption from <hi>Egypt.</hi> Their feaſt of Ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bernacles plainly ſhewed them the eſtate of their Fathers in the Wilderneſs. And ſo the Sacrament of the Lords Supper does after a lively manner repreſent unto us the Death of our Bleſſed Saviour. He died
<pb n="19" facs="tcp:59207:18"/>indeed a great while ſince, and at a place far remote from us, there could be but few that were eye-witneſſes of what was then and there done; but few in proportion with thoſe that would be concerned in his death. And therefore God out of his great mercy to us hath ordained this ſervice, that what we could not ſee done at firſt, we might ſee repeated in the Sacrament after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards. Here we have Chriſt crucifyed repreſented to us: The Bread and Wine put us in mind of his Body and Blood. And when we ſee the Bread broken, and the Wine poured forth we are taught to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>member the Paſſion of our Lord; how his body was broken and bruiſed, and his blood was ſhed for us. God would have us <hi>lift up our hearts</hi> from theſe ſymbols and ſigns to that which is ſignified and repre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſented by them. And if we do ſo we may by our Faith ſee Chriſt crucified before our eyes. And that which was done ſo long ago, and ſo far off will be anew repreſented unto us. The Apoſtle tells his <hi>Galatians</hi> that <hi>before their eyes Jeſus Chriſt had been evidently ſet forth, and crucified among them,</hi> Gal. 3.1. Yet certain it is that Jeſus Chriſt was crucifyed at <hi>Jeruſalem,</hi> a place very far remote from the Country of the <hi>Gala<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tians:</hi> But yet he that was crucified at <hi>Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruſalem</hi>
                  <pb n="20" facs="tcp:59207:19"/>may well be ſaid to have been evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dently ſet forth before the eyes of the <hi>Ga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>latians,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Verſ. Syriac.</note> and crucified among them alſo, <hi>i. e.</hi> Jeſus Chriſt crucified was as it were painted and moſt lively re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſented unto them. They did not ſee him indeed hanging on the Croſs at <hi>Jeru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſalem,</hi> but yet by the preaching of the Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpel, and celebration of this Sacrament they might behold Chriſt crucified, and that which was done at ſo great a diſtance would by theſe means become as if it had been done before their eyes.</p>
               <p>But it is not a bare hiſtorical remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brance that will ſerve our turn neither. It is no hard thing to be able to remember the hiſtory of the paſſion of our Bleſſed Saviour: But our remembrance of it muſt be,</p>
               <p n="1">(1.) Affectionate and vigorous, as we remember the death of a dear friend that died, and died in our quarrel and defence, who at once ſhed his blood for us and for the truth. How paſſionately can we re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hearſe the praiſes and preſerve the memo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry of ſuch an one as this: 'Twas thus with our deareſt Lord, he fell a Sacrifice at once for the teſtimony of the truth, and for the ſake of our precious Souls. He died that he might reſcue us from eternal miſery and
<pb n="21" facs="tcp:59207:19"/>death. And this we muſt remember when we do remember the death of our Bleſſed Lord.</p>
               <p n="2">(2.) With all thankfulneſs to God for ſo unſpeakable a mercy. Let us awaken our Pſaltery and Harp, all our powers and faculties, and all that is within us to praiſe his holy name. Let us have our hymn of praiſe, <hi>Matth.</hi> 26.30. 'Tis an heavenly feaſt we are going to, and who goes to a feaſt with a ſad countenance or heart? <hi>Let us be filled with the ſpirit: Speaking to our ſelves in Pſalms and Hymns, and ſpiri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tual Songs, and making melody in our hearts to the Lord,</hi> Epheſ. 5.18, 19. We are Gods gueſts at this time, and God loves we ſhould be chearful and rejoyce. He would have the <hi>Jews</hi> ſo in their Feſtivals, <hi>Deut.</hi> 16.11, 14. And certainly we have more reaſon to be ſo than they, <hi>God hav<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing provided ſome better thing for us,</hi> Heb. 11.40. This Sacrament is an Euchariſt or ſervice of praiſe, and as ſuch was ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerved by the firſt Chriſtians, <hi>Who break<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing bread from houſe to houſe, did eat their meat with gladneſs and ſingleneſs of heart, praiſing God and having favour with all the people,</hi> Act. 2.46, 47.</p>
               <p n="3">(3.) It muſt be ſuch a remembrance as works in us a deteſtation againſt our ſins
<pb n="22" facs="tcp:59207:20"/>which put our Bleſſed Saviour to death. Co<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="4 letters">

That you ſaw the Sun darkened, the Dead ariſe, and the rocky Earth rend in pieces; certainly if your hearts were not more hard than the rocks, you would relent; eſpecially when you conſider that all this was for your ſins, and that he died that you might live.

               <p n="3">III. Another great end of this Sacrament is that Chriſtians might by it be united to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether in the ſtricteſt bond of love and charity. It is indeed a feaſt of love, and that which does not only joyn us to God, but firmly cements us alſo to one ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther.</p>
               <p>This indeed is the great Commande<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of our Bleſſed Saviour, that we ſhould love one another as He hath loved us, <hi>John</hi> 15.12. Nay he hath made this the mark by which his followers ſhall be known from the reſt of the World. <hi>By this ſhall all men know that ye are my Diſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples, if ye have love one to another,</hi> Joh. 13.35. And in the early days of Chriſtianity
<pb n="24" facs="tcp:59207:21"/>the Heathen. World took notice <hi>how the Chriſtians loved one another.</hi> Nay the Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly Scriptures tell us that in the beginning of Chriſtianity, <hi>The multitude of them that believed were of one Heart and of one Soul,</hi> Act. 4.32. And they ſhewed their love to one another by making all things common, that there might be no lack and wants a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong them, <hi>Acts</hi> 2.44, 45. But then 'tis added when it was that they loved one another thus greatly, <hi>viz.</hi> While <hi>they con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinuing daily with one accord in the Temple, and breaking bread from houſe to houſe, did eat their meat with gladneſs and ſingleneſs of heart, verſe.</hi> 46. Whiles there were fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quent Communions in the Church of God, there did remain a fervent Charity among Chriſtians. But when they were but ſeldome celebrated, Charity alſo grew cold.</p>
               <p>For indeed this Sacrament was appoint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed for the keeping up a fervent charity a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong the followers of Jeſus. And very plain, methinks are the words of the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtle to this purpoſe, <hi>We being many are one bread, and one body, for we are all partakers of that one bread,</hi> 1 Cor. 10.17. <hi>i. e.</hi> We that partake of this Heavenly feaſt are by that made one, we are of one kind and <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 word">
                     <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
                  </gap>, juſt as Bread and Wine though they
<pb n="25" facs="tcp:59207:21"/>be made up of ſeveral grains and grapes, yet are made up together into one ſimilar body, all whoſe parts are homogeneous and of the ſame ſort or kind; ſo we that are Chriſtians, tho as men we differ from one another, and have our ſeveral affections and deſigns diſtinct from each other, yet for all this by the death of our Saviour, and by the participation of the Sacrament of our Lords Supper we are made one; we are reconciled to the ſame deſigns and intereſts, acted by the ſame Spirit and by this Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment united into one Spiritual body. How<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever we are other wiſe <hi>divided,</hi> it is the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tention of this Sacrament to make us <hi>One.</hi> And therefore the Ancients called the Eu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chariſt, <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>, <hi>i. e.</hi> a Collection or gathe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring together into one thoſe who were otherwiſe divided. The partaking of this Feaſt makes the partakers of one mind and heart where they do receive it worthily. What is ſaid of <hi>Pilate</hi> and <hi>Herod,</hi> when our Saviour was about to ſuffer, <hi>That they were the ſame day made friends together, who before had been at enmity between themſelves,</hi> Luke 23.12. The ſame is true of all true Chriſtians that do aright partake of this Sacrament of the death of Chriſt, they are now united and reconciled, and made of one heart and mind.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="26" facs="tcp:59207:22"/>And this ſeems to be the great deſign of the Euchariſt to unite Chriſtians together in the cloſeſt bond of unity and love. When the Paſſe-over was commanded a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong the <hi>Jews,</hi> they were moſt ſeverely commanded to put away leaven when they kept that Feaſt: when we keep this Feaſt we muſt be ſure to lay aſide all malice and ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tred; to that ſenſe the Apoſtle expounds that paſſage to us. <hi>Purge out therefore the old leaven, that ye may be a new lump, as ye are unleavened; for even Chriſt our Paſſover is ſacrificed for us. Therefore let us keep the feaſt, not with old leaven, neither with the leaven of malice and wickedneſs, but with the unleavened bread of ſincerity and truth,</hi> 1 Cor. 5.7, 8. He that bears malice in his heart muſt ſtand away and not partake of theſe holy myſteries. Such a man will not be welcome to this Table of the Lord. If we like <hi>Cain,</hi> hate our brother, God will have no reſpect unto our offering, <hi>Gen.</hi> 4.5. God is pleaſed to ſee us at uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty with one another, and till then our ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crifice is an abomination unto the Lord. <hi>Therefore if thou bring thy gift to the Altar, and there remembreſt that thy brother hath ought against thee; leave there thy gift be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the Altar, and go thy way, firſt be recon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciled to thy brother, and then come and offer
<pb n="27" facs="tcp:59207:22"/>thy gift,</hi> Matth. 5.23, 24. God is wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling to ſtay for his offering till we are re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conciled to one another.</p>
               <p>And as we ought alwayes to have our hearts clear from the malice and bitterneſs which we are too apt to bear againſt our brother; ſo eſpecially when we keep this Feaſt, we ought to ſee to it that we be purged from the leaven. For we do now keep in memory the death of Chriſt. And certainly Chriſt in his death gave a great proof of his love to Mankind, and a great example alſo of forgiveneſs of enemies. And methinks we ſhould be aſhamed to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>member the death of Chriſt, who died for ſinners, and prayed for his enemies, when we retain our hatred and ill-will againſt our brother. For if we did but rightly conſider it, we ſhall find the death of Chriſt a very effectual means to deſtroy out of our hearts all malice and ill-will, and hatred to one another. Well may we forgive one another when Chriſt for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gave his greateſt enemies, and prayed for his Crucifiers, <hi>Father for give them, for they know not what they do.</hi> We may well con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain our ſelves and be quiet when we are reproached and falſly accuſed; when our Saviour, <hi>Who did no ſin, neither was guile found in his mouth; yet when he was re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viled,
<pb n="28" facs="tcp:59207:23"/>reviled not again; when he ſuffered he threatned not; but committed himſelf to him that judgeth righteouſly,</hi> 1 Pet. 2.22, 23. Methinks when Chriſt hath ſhewn ſuch a love to us, it ſhould be no hard mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter for us to love one another. When Chriſt hath paid ſo great a debt for us, we ſhould not readily pull our brother by the throat for every treſpaſs. If we did but re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flect upon the death of Chriſt, as we ought to do, it would kill and deſtroy that ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lice and hatred which lodges in our hearts. We ſhould not find it ſo hard a matter to forgive our enemy, to do good againſt evil, and to pray for our perſecuters and ſlanderers, if we did, as we ought to do, keep in mind the death of our dear Lord and Saviour.</p>
               <p>But then they that eat of the ſame bread, and drink of the ſame cup, that partake together at the Table of their Lord muſt needs think themſelves obliged to love one another. For if eating and drinking together have been thought an argument of kindneſs and friendſhip, cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainly then the partaking together of theſe divine myſteries muſt needs call for the ſincereſt amity, and the moſt fervent cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity amongſt thoſe that do partake. Thoſe that ſeed at the ſame Table, that retain to
<pb n="29" facs="tcp:59207:23"/>the ſame Lord, that wear the ſame badg and livery that ſhews to whom they do belong, and live by the ſame Laws, and muſt therefore hope for the ſame reward, theſe men ſure muſt needs think themſelves obliged to love one another. Their par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taking together of theſe myſteries is a ſure pledge of that mutual kindneſs which is be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween them. When the Pſalmiſt would deſcribe the greateſt profeſſion of friend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip and intimacy between himſelf and his profeſſed friends he does it in theſe words, <hi>We took ſweet counſel together, and walked unto the houſe of God in Company,</hi> Pſal. 55.14. We profeſs our ſelves Children of the ſame houſhold and family when we do par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>take together of this holy Feaſt. We de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clare that we are members of the ſame body when we eat of the ſame Bread, and drink of the ſame Cup, which is that proviſion, that heavenly aliment, which our Lord hath provided for his Church. And therefore we ought to be concerned for one another as members of the ſame body are. We ought to care for the good and benefit each of other, and to ſhew by our lives and actions that we do believe theſe things to be true. We ought indeed to be in perfect charity with all men; &amp; as we have opportunity to do good unto all men too, but more eſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially,
<pb n="30" facs="tcp:59207:24"/>are we obliged to do good unto the houſhold of Faith.</p>
               <p>The ancient Chriſtians ſurely under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtood this very well. They ſhewed a great kindneſs to thoſe who did communi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cate with them. When they received this holy Sacrament they ſaluted one another with an holy kiſs in token of that mutual love and kindneſs that was betwixt them. And as they had their <hi>kiſs of love,</hi> ſo after the Celebration of this Sacrament they had their <hi>feaſt of love,</hi> where they did eat to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether in common in teſtimony of the mu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tual kindneſs which was between them. And again, they had their <hi>labour of love alſo. i. e.</hi> They made collections for thoſe that were poor among them, or in diſtreſs; they were not only at peace with one ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, but they had alſo a very great com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paſſion for all thoſe that were afflicted.</p>
               <p>But alaſs, we are not what they were; that which was to them the bond of unity and love, we have made a bone of con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tention and quarrel. We <hi>diſpute</hi> now, we do not <hi>live;</hi> we are full of <hi>questions,</hi> and <hi>void of charity.</hi> We are not willing to be ſo <hi>good</hi> as thoſe Primitive Chriſtians, though we deſire to ſeem as <hi>wiſe</hi> as they. We are greatly declined from that love and unity that then obtained. And we are not wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling
<pb n="31" facs="tcp:59207:24"/>to be reſtored to that zeal and fervour which was to be ſeen in them. And now we are run into two great extreams; for either we receive this Sacrament with the leaven of malice in our hearts, and when we are unprepared for it, and then this holy Table becomes our ſnare: Or elſe we will not receive it at all, leſt we ſhould be obliged ſeverely to be that, which we are not willing to become.</p>

Another great end of this Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment is that we might have a full aſſurance of Gods readineſs to beſtow upon us a pardon of our ſins, and the great mercies of the Goſpel which God hath declared himſelf ready to beſtow upon all thoſe who perform the conditions of the new Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant. God is not only pleaſed to make a Covenant with us, and plainly to declare his readineſs to perform his part, but alſo gives us his ſeal, and ſo does abundantly aſſure us of his own ſtedfaſtneſs and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtancy.</p>
               <p>For ſuch is our weakneſs, ſo great our unbelief that we need very great ſupports, and an abundant aſſurance to buoy up our ſinking and incredulous hearts. And on the other hand ſo great is the meroy and condeſcenſion of our gracious God that he is ready to conſider our frame, and
<pb n="32" facs="tcp:59207:25"/>to give us the greater ſecurity &amp; aſſurance. He does not only <hi>promiſe</hi> us the pardon of our ſins in his New Covenant, but he al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſo gives us his <hi>ſeal</hi> to it beſides; <hi>That ſo by two immutable things, in which it was im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſſible for God to lie, we might have a ſtrong conſolation, who have fled for refuge to lay hold upon the hope ſet before us,</hi> Heb. 2.18. Thus gratiouſly does God deal with Man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kind. He gives them his <hi>Covenant</hi> and his <hi>Seal</hi> too. He not only gives out his <hi>decree</hi> in the expreſſes of his will, but he <hi>ſignes</hi> and <hi>ſeals</hi> it alſo that we may be aſſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red that it is unalterable; as it is ſaid the Law of the <hi>Medes</hi> and <hi>Perſians</hi> in that caſe was, <hi>Dan.</hi> 6.8. God makes a Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant with <hi>Noah</hi> and his ſons that he will no more deſtroy the earth by a flood; but to give them ſtill a greater aſſurance, he ſets his bow in the cloud as a token of this Covenant between himſelf and them. (<hi>Gen.</hi> 9.) And when God makes a Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant with <hi>Abraham</hi> and with his ſeed, he does command Circumciſion as a <hi>token</hi> of this <hi>Covenant</hi> between himſelf and them, <hi>Gen.</hi> 17.11. God does not only give us his Word, but his Sacrament the token of his truth. This God does, becauſe he is gracious, and becauſe our wretched unbe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lief is ſo great that we need the utmoſt aſſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance.
<pb n="33" facs="tcp:59207:25"/>And this certainly is one great end of the Sacrament, that we might have al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wayes with us a <hi>ſure pledge</hi> of the favour and grace of God, that we might not miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>carry through our unbelief, that we might have a full aſſurance that God would par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don our ſins if we do on our part perform the condition of the New Covenant. Our Saviours words are plain to this purpoſe, <hi>This is my blood of the New Teſtament, which is ſhed for many for the remiſſion of ſins,</hi> Matth. 28.26. This Sacrament is the inſtrument of conveyance, the Seal that gives us right and title to this great grace and mercy of God. We receive in this Sacrament the Body and Blood of Chriſt, and the benefits of his Death: The pardon of our ſin is here made over to us; God hath given us viſible pledges of his readineſs to forgive our ſins. And becauſe we are very jealous and ſuſpicious, very unapt to believe that ſuch wretches as we are ſhould be received into Gods favour, he hath given us this abundant aſſurance. He receives us to his own Table, gives us under the ſymbols of Bread and Wine, the Body and Blood of his Son, who died for our ſins, and entertains us with this food of heaven.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="34" facs="tcp:59207:26"/>In that God hath given us his Son, and given him up to death, and this death he un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derwent for our ſins, we have a great aſſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance that with him he will give us all things, and that he is ready to pardon thoſe ſins for which our Lord hath ſhed his blood. But then this bleſſed Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment is greatly efficacious towards the ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taining of this pardon, becauſe it is the miniſtery of the Death of Chriſt, by which our pardon was procured.</p>
               <p>But then we muſt be careful that we do not think that our pardon is procured by any inherent vertue of the outward ele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments of Bread and Wine, or that our partaking of theſe alone will procure this remiſſion of ſins: For the pardon of ſin is procured by the blood of our Saviour, and we attain not to it without a lively faith, and a performing the conditions of the Goſpel. But if we do this we have good aſſurance of pardon when we par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>take of this Sacrament which is the Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtery of the Death of Chriſt. But then we muſt have a faith in Chriſt; that is, as we eat the outward Element of Bread, and drink the Wine, ſo muſt our Souls receive our Lord Jeſus Chriſt. They muſt enter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain him with all his precepts, and in all his offices. Our hearts muſt receive him
<pb n="35" facs="tcp:59207:26"/>as our <hi>Prophet</hi> to <hi>inſtruct</hi> and <hi>teach</hi> us; as our <hi>Lord</hi> to <hi>rule</hi> and <hi>govern</hi> us, as well as our <hi>Prieſt</hi> to make a <hi>ſatisfaction</hi> for us to the Divine Juſtice. And as we hunger and thirſt for our bodily food, ſo we muſt hunger after the Spiritual proviſions that Chriſt hath made for our Souls. We muſt earneſtly breathe after righteouſneſs, and purity of heart. There muſt be in our Souls an hunger and a thirſt, they muſt receive and feed, and not our bodies on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly. <hi>It is the ſpirit that quickeneth, the fleſh profiteth nothing,</hi> John 6.63. As our mouth eats the outward element, ſo faith muſt eat too. And it is not a <hi>notion,</hi> not an <hi>empty nothing</hi> that will feed a lively faith: It conveys as real a ſupply to the Soul as the outward Elements do nouriſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment to the body. The body receives the outward ſymbol, the Soul the inward grace. We eat and drink the Element, but 'tis the Soul that feeds on the thing ſig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nified and repreſented.</p>
               <p>And therefore let not the ſinner who lives in his ſin and loves it, think to ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain his pardon by partaking of this Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crament. This Sacrament will not avail ſuch a man as this is; for the death of Chriſt will profit him nothing if he lives in his ſins and loves them; and therefore this
<pb n="36" facs="tcp:59207:27"/>Sacrament can avail him nothing, it being but the Annunciation of the Death of Chriſt; and therefore it cannot ſave that ſinner whom the death of his Lord does not avail. It is a vain thing for ſuch a ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner to take ſanctuary here. If there be not in our ſouls a principle of new Life it is not the outward Elements of Bread and Wine that will help us. God is ready to forgive our ſins, (and we may ſee it clear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly in this Sacrament) but while we love our ſins we are uncapable of this grace of God. 'Tis the burdened and the ladened ſinner that ſhall find this favour. 'Tis he that hates his ſin and ſtrives againſt it. Theſe are thoſe whom Chriſt came to ſeek and ſave. 'Tis not the outward work will ſave us if there be not in us the grace of God. There is no pardon in the Goſpel for the obdurate and impenitent ſinner, and therefore we may not look for it in any of the exterior offices of Religion: And therefore let no man deceive himſelf in this matter. He that comes in his ſins out of hopes of a pardon will be ſo far de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived, that inſtead of obtaining a pardon for his former guilt he will contract a grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, and inſtead of preventing he will but increaſe and enhaunce his own con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demnation.</p>

               <p>I Shall now mention ſome of thoſe pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctical Inferences which the ſeverals be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forenamed do ſuggeſt unto us.</p>
               <p n="1">1. If this Sacrament be intended for a renewal of that Covenant we entered in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to in Baptiſm, we may ſee what great rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon we have at this time to examine our ſelves, and to bewail our miſdeeds, and ſtrengthen all purpoſes of amendment of Life. The end of its inſtitution does moſt ſeverely and indiſpenſably require all this at our hands. We muſt prepare our ſelves to meet the Lord that he may be ſanctifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by us when we draw nigh unto him. We read that at the giving of the Law when the <hi>Iſraelites</hi> entered into Covenant with God, how ſolemnly they were pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pared for it, (<hi>Exod.</hi> 19.14, 15.) leſt their uncleanneſs ſhould render them un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fit for ſo great a work. God is holy, and they that make their approaches to him
<pb n="38" facs="tcp:59207:28"/>muſt be ſo likewiſe: We muſt purifie and cleanſe our hearts, and caſt out every thing which does defile before we are fit to make ſo ſolemn an addreſs to Almighty God. <hi>God will be ſanctified in them that come nigh him,</hi> Lev. 10.3. Certainly God is too <hi>wiſe</hi> to be <hi>impoſed</hi> upon and <hi>mocked;</hi> too <hi>holy</hi> to <hi>behold</hi> our <hi>iniquities,</hi> too <hi>juſt</hi> to <hi>clear</hi> and <hi>abſolve</hi> the <hi>obdurate</hi> and <hi>impeni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent</hi> ſinner. We muſt not come to this holy Table before we have examined our own hearts, and bewailed our ſins, and come we muſt with full purpoſes of amend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of Life. If we cannot find that we are thus prepared we muſt not dare to ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venture. If we find that we love our ſins and are not willing to part with them we ſhall eat and drink damnation to our ſelves when we eat of this bread and drink of this Cup.</p>
               <p n="2">2. Hence alſo we may ſee the great obligation that lies upon thoſe which do partake of theſe holy myſteries to lead ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly lives for the time to come.

A relapſe is many times of greater danger than the firſt diſeaſe. 'Tis always ſo in ſpiritual things. He that commits the ſame ſin af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter he hath communicated contracts a greater guilt. He does not only ſin a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt his <hi>Conſcience,</hi> but againſt his moſt ſolemn <hi>Vow</hi> and <hi>promiſe.</hi> He ſins againſt greater grace, and with greater ſcandal; he offends them that communicate with him, and opens the mouths of them that do not. He does by his Saviour as <hi>Judas</hi> did, he <hi>eats</hi> of his <hi>bread,</hi> and lifts up <hi>his heel againſt him,</hi> Joh. 13.18. The ſin of an unbeliever is great, but this is much greater ſtill; this is the higheſt treachery and falſeneſs. We betray Chriſt when yet with <hi>Judas</hi> we kiſs him, and ſalute him with an <hi>Hail Maſter.</hi> Nothing can be more deteſtable than this is. No wonder that the rule Soldiers and the Roman <hi>Pi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>late</hi> ſhould be unkind to our Saviour, but that a Diſciple ſhould deny him, and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tray him, this is that which ſwells the ſin to the greateſt magnitude.</p>

Do not deſpiſe the Blood of Chriſt, <hi>who died for all, that they which live ſhould not hence<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forth live unto themſelves, but unto him which died for them, and roſe again,</hi> 2 Cor. 5.15.</p>
               <p>Know this that if you <hi>ſin wilfully</hi> now, <hi>there remains no more ſacrifice for ſin, but a certain fearful looking for of judgment, and fiery indignation, which ſhall devour the ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſaries,</hi>
                  <pb n="41" facs="tcp:59207:29"/>Heb. 10.26, 27. God will not be mocked by thoſe that trample on the Blood of his Son: <hi>It is a fearful thing to fall into the hands of the living God.</hi> You run into an unſpeakable danger whatever you may think of it. You have entered into Covenant with God and you cannot fall back without contracting a great guilt unto your ſelves. It was the ancient man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner that when a Covenant was made they did ſlay a beaſt, ſhed its blood, and cut it aſunder, <hi>Jer.</hi> 34.18, 19. in token that he that did not ſtand to his Covenant ſhould himſelf be obnoxious to the like ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verity. When God makes a Covenant with us in the Goſpel, he gives up his Son to death; the blood which he ſhed is the blood of this Covenant. (<hi>Heb.</hi> 13.20. <hi>and</hi> 10.19.) If now we tranſgreſs and trample upon the blood of Jeſus we are liable to all the wrath of God which our Lord endured, and to bear it alſo to all eternity. And though we may eſcape temporal plagues, yet will it be worſe for us if we fall into hardneſs of heart, blind<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of mind and a reprobate ſenſe. Theſe are the <hi>ſurda verbera,</hi> thoſe ſecret and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>numming ſtrokes, thoſe ſtupifying ones which do not indeed ſo much amuſe our ſenſes, and render us examples to others
<pb n="42" facs="tcp:59207:30"/>of Gods diſpleaſure; but yet they are of as ill an Omen and preſage, and of a worſe conſequence by far than the heavi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt and ſoreſt afflictions that befall our eſtates or bodies in this preſent world.</p>
               <p>You then that have been cleanſing and purifying your ſelves, have a care that you do not defile your ſelves again. Let eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry ſuch man rather ſay with the ſpouſe, <hi>I have put off my coat, how ſhall I put it on? I have waſhed my feet, how ſhall I defile them?</hi> Cant. 5.3. Have a care you do not with the <hi>dog</hi> return to your <hi>vomit,</hi> and with the <hi>ſow</hi> that was <hi>waſhed</hi> to the <hi>wallowing</hi> in the <hi>mire,</hi> 2 <hi>Pet.</hi> 2.22. I ſhall conclude this particular with the words of <hi>Siracides, He that waſheth himſelf after the touching of a dead body, if he touch it again what availeth his waſhing? So is it with a man that faſteth for his ſins, and goeth again and doth the ſame, who will hear his prayer, or what doth his humbling profit him,</hi> Eccleſ. 34.25, 26.</p>
               <p n="3">3. Hence we may ſee what great reaſon we have to give thanks to God that he is pleaſed to make that our duty which is ſo much our intereſt and for our advantage. He obliges us to renew our Covenant with himſelf, which it is our greateſt intereſt to do. He obliges us to that which tends to
<pb n="43" facs="tcp:59207:30"/>our own happineſs and welfare, and with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out which we could not but be miſerable. He will have us remember the death of our Saviour, and his love he ſhewed us. He will have us partake of a Sacrament that does not only bring us nearer to himſelf, but alſo unites us faſter in the bond of love to one another. He would that we ſhould partake of theſe Myſteries, which are the ſeal of his Covenant, and give us great aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſurance of his readineſs to pardon our ſins. That is, in one word, God would have us be happy, and he does oblige us to be ſo. 'Tis our advantage that he deſigns in all this. His love is without any intereſt but that of ours. Who would not enter into Covenant with ſo good a God? who would not remember the love of ſo dear a Lord? Who would not be knit faſt to his brother in cloſeſt bond of love? Who would not have aſſurance of the pardon of his ſins? Theſe are the greateſt bleſſings that we are capable of receiving; the greateſt that Heaven can beſtow upon us. What can be more deſireable than to be at peace with God, and at unity among our ſelves? What more reaſonable or more to be wiſhed for than that we ſhould re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>member the love of our Saviour, and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive a good aſſurance of the pardon of
<pb n="44" facs="tcp:59207:31"/>our ſins? And this is the deſign, as you have heard, of this bleſſed Sacrament. It is appointed for ſuch bleſſed purpoſes as theſe. How ſuſpicious or ſhy ſoever we be of it, this is the errand it comes about. It hath a deſign to make us more holy and more happy than we were. This is all the plot which it hath upon us; God hath not only been pleaſed to give us his Son to die for our ranſom, but he gives him a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gain in this Sacrament for our food and nouriſhment. O the unſpeakableneſs of Gods kindneſs to us! Methinks every man ſhould break forth into his praiſes; me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thinks he ſhould ſay, <hi>Bleſs the Lord, O my Soul, and forget not all his benefits, who forgiveth all thine iniquities, who healeth all thy diſeaſes, who redeemeth thy life from de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruction, who crowneth thee with loving kindneſs and tender mercies, who ſatisfieth thy mouth with good things,</hi> Pſal. 103.2, 3, 4, 5. Methinks our mouth ſhould be filled with praiſe and thankſgiving to God, for theſe his kindneſſes to our Souls.</p>
               <p n="4">4. Hence we may learn, what great reaſon we have to embrace ſo bleſſed an opportunity of becoming better. Great are the benefits which would redound to us from <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap> frequent and a devout Commu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion.
<pb n="45" facs="tcp:59207:31"/>And certainly this ſervice muſt needs be welcome to that Soul that is weary of his ſins, and heartily and ear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſtly deſires to be rid of them. For it lays a moſt ſevere obligation upon us to ſearch our hearts, and amend our ways, and ſet things ſtraight between God and our own Souls. This ſervice obligeth us to that which every pious Soul would chuſe of it ſelf. It binds us to be faithful ſervants of God, to be hearty lovers of our brother, to be grateful acknowledgers of the love of Chriſt, and diligent ſeekers after the pardon of our ſins. Who would not welcome ſuch a bleſſed opportunity that loves his God and is weary of his ſins? Who is it that deſires to lead a new life that would not be glad of ſo excellent a ſervice? 'Tis to be feared we are too much wedded to our ſins, when we refuſe this ſervice which would divorce them from us! 'Tis much to be feared we have no great ſenſe of the love of our dying Savi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>our when we will not upon his command, <hi>Do this in remembrance of him.</hi> Or that our ſins are no burden to us when we de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpiſe the evidence of our pardon. If we did but worthily partake of this Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, we ſhould be more fit to live and more prepar'd to die. We ſhould be
<pb n="46" facs="tcp:59207:32"/>more fervent in our ſervices to God, and more ſincere in our love to our brother; the love of Chriſt would conſtrain us to obedience, and his Commandements would not be grievous to us. This would put an end to our unnatural diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rences and quarrels, it would reſtore love and charity, it would deliver us from our ſlaviſh and dreadful fear of death. In a word it would change this <hi>Earth</hi> into a kind of <hi>Heaven;</hi> and him that is now a cold profeſſor of Religion, it would make this <hi>Sinner</hi> become a <hi>Saint,</hi> and a zealous doer of the will of God.</p>
               <p>Such a mighty change would a frequent and a worthy participation of theſe my<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſteries introduce into the world. It would bring back the primitive ſpirit in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the hearts of Chriſtians, when Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munions were frequent and devout, then did every holy and good thing obtain. And were they again reſtored, the De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vils Kingdom, which hath now gotten ground, would not only ſhake but fall to the ground. This would overturn his ſtrong-holds, as the barly-cake of <hi>Gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deon</hi> did the Tents of the men of <hi>Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dian.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="47" facs="tcp:59207:32"/>And therefore no wonder that he la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bours ſo greatly by his inſtruments to pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vent this, which would ſubvert his Kingdom. And this is ſo effectually done that now the profeſſors of Chriſtianity either par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>take amiſs or not at all. This is the caſe of many, I wiſh I could not ſay of the moſt of Chriſtians. Nay and thoſe that do not receive at all are grown witty too, they think they can defend themſelves from being guilty of a default. I ſhall not here examine what they have to ſay for themſelves; but yet this I ſhall ſay that the command of our Saviour for our Communicating is ſo plain, and the reaſon of it ſo great that nothing can diſcharge us from it, but either the impoſſibility of doing it for want of opportunity, (which we cannot plead) or a countermand from him that gave us the law which we muſt never expect. Nothing elſe can diſcharge us, not our common excuſes, not our mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtaken and ſcrupulous Conſciences, which cannot evacuate the Law of God; for hereafter we ſhall be judged not accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to what we <hi>ween</hi> or are of <hi>opinion</hi> in the caſe, but by a more ſure and unerr<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing rule, the VVord of God. I conclude this particular, only adding that if we di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miniſh
<pb n="48" facs="tcp:59207:33"/>or take from the Word of God, and deny that to be our duty which the Word of God requires, we have too much reaſon to fear that God will take away our part out of the book of life, <hi>Rev.</hi> 22.19.</p>

               <p n="1">1. He that cometh unprepared loſeth all thoſe benefits which are annexed to a wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thy partaking of this Sacrament. Cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainly
<pb n="49" facs="tcp:59207:33"/>the bleſſings which we receive when we come prepared are very many and ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry great. We receive the <hi>pardon</hi> of our <hi>ſins,</hi> and <hi>power</hi> againſt them; we have here a ſenſe and experiment of the <hi>love</hi> of <hi>Chriſt</hi> to <hi>us,</hi> and increaſe of our charity and <hi>love</hi> to one <hi>another.</hi> We receive here the <hi>joys</hi> of <hi>pure Religion,</hi> and the <hi>foretaſts</hi> of Heaven; an increaſe of <hi>our love</hi> to <hi>God,</hi> and a demonſtration alſo of the <hi>love of God to us.</hi> This is a moſt excellent inſtru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, and very available to the <hi>killing</hi> of our <hi>ſins,</hi> and the <hi>reviving</hi> of our <hi>graces.</hi> It makes us more <hi>fit</hi> to <hi>live,</hi> and both more <hi>ready,</hi> and more <hi>willing</hi> to <hi>die.</hi> We are here reconciled to God, and alſo per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fectly reconciled to one another. 'Tis the great inſtrument of pardon, and peace, of love and joy, of faith and holineſs. He that comes prepared finds it both food and phyſick. It nouriſhes his graces, and it purges away his ſins. But whatever bleſſings he finds, the unprepared finds none. He receives no pardon of his ſin, nor yet any power againſt it. And it were well for the unprepared if this were all, for he does not only not receive a bleſſing; but,</p>
               <p n="2">2. He that comes unprepared receives a very great curſe; he contracts a very great
<pb n="50" facs="tcp:59207:34"/>guilt and condemnation to himſelf. And if he would know how great a curſe it is let him conſider the words of the Apoſtle, who tells him that he is <hi>guilty of the body and blood of Chriſt,</hi> 1 Cor. 11.27, That <hi>he eateth and drinketh damnation to himſelf,</hi> v. 29 Nor is this all neither, but he brings upon himſelf bodily diſtempers, aye and death it ſelf. The Apoſtle adds, <hi>for this cauſe many are weak and ſickly among you, and many ſleep,</hi> ver. 30. We have enough ſaid to awaken us in theſe words if any thing be enough. Sickneſs and death are the greateſt plagues that we dread in the World; and theſe are conſequents of unworthy receiving; but theſe are the leaſt ſtill. He that comes unprepared as he is guilty of the <hi>greateſt ſin,</hi> in that he is <hi>guilty of the Body and Blood of Christ,</hi> ſo is he liable to the greateſt ſeverity and wrath of God, in that he eats and drinks <hi>damnation to himſelf.</hi> If we would avoid ſickneſs, or an untimely death, if we would not be guilty of the Body and Blood of Chriſt, and not be liable to damnation we muſt prepare our ſelves for this ſervice. We think <hi>Judas</hi> a wretched ſinner that betrayed his Lord, and <hi>Pilate</hi> that deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vered him to death and the <hi>Jews</hi> that cru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cified him we eſteem moſt miſerable ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners;
<pb n="51" facs="tcp:59207:34"/>what are we then if we do all this over again; if we crucifie our Lord a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>freſh, and tread under foot the Son of God, and count the blood of the Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant an unholy thing; and all this we do if we come unprepared and in our ſins: And are ſo far from being leſs ſinners than the <hi>Jews</hi> who crucified our Lord, that we are indeed therefore greater than they, in that we do this deſpite to him whom we know; but they, though they crucified him, yet they did not know him to be the Lord of Glory.</p>
               <p>The receiving of this Sacrament ſerves to ſome great purpoſe or other; it does ſet us forward either to Heaven or Hell; it conveys a great bleſſing, or elſe it brings upon us a great curſe. And as the bleſſings, it brings are great to them that are prepared, ſo are the curſes to him that comes unfit. We either receive Chriſt or elſe Satan enters into us. And all this is as we come fitted and pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pared.</p>
               <p>Nor is it to be wondred that it ſhould be ſo, for it is not the <hi>work done,</hi> but the <hi>manner</hi> of the <hi>doing</hi> of it that turns to our account. God deals with us not as with ſtocks and ſtones, but as with reaſonable Creatures. We receive his bleſſings as we
<pb n="52" facs="tcp:59207:35"/>are ſitted for them. God waits that he may be gracious. He waits on us till we ſit our ſelves to receive his mercy. The Soul that is unprepared is not ſit for the bleſſings that are here beſtowed. 'Tis our unfitneſs to receive that makes us miſs of the bleſſing. 'Tis ſo in all our religious ſervices. We receive no benefit becauſe we are not fitted for them; nay inſtead of a bleſſing we receive a curſe. We do not profit by the preaching of the Word, we ſay; The cauſe is becauſe we are not prepared hearers. <hi>Do not my words do good to him that walketh uprightly? Micah</hi> 2.7. We are worſe after the Word we hear, and the Sacrament we partake of, becauſe we are unprepared. And that is the true cauſe of it. We have an Axiom in Logick, <hi>That every cauſe does act according to the diſpoſition of the ſubject;</hi> 'tis true in Spirituals I am ſure. That which is to one a great bleſſing turns to the miſchief of another. One man receives life when he eats of this bread and drinks of this cup, another man through his own default eats and drinks damnation to himſelf. The ſame heat of the Sun that diſſolves the ice and melts the wax, yet hardens the clay. The ſame herb or flower may afford honey to the Bee, and poyſon to the Spider. The
<pb n="53" facs="tcp:59207:35"/>Red Sea that gave a paſſage to the <hi>Iſrae<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lites</hi> did for all that drown the <hi>Egypti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans.</hi>

               <p>We know the Ark of God was the <hi>glory</hi> of <hi>Iſrael,</hi> and a great bleſſing to the Houſe of <hi>Obed Edom,</hi> but yet the <hi>Philiſtines</hi> found it an intolerable ſcourge to them. Nay Chriſt himſelf that unſpeakable gift who is to them that believe the <hi>power</hi> of <hi>God</hi> and the <hi>wiſdom</hi> of <hi>God,</hi> yet was he to the unbelieving Jews a <hi>ſtumbling block,</hi> and to the Greeks <hi>fooliſhneſs,</hi> 1 Cor. 1.23, 24.</p>

               </q>
               <p>So that it concerns us greatly to fit and prepare our ſelves for ſo great a ſervice. It will be unto us as we are prepared for it. Our unfitneſs will turn life into death,
<pb n="54" facs="tcp:59207:36"/>and the greateſt bleſſing that God hath to beſtow into the greateſt curſe. There is a great danger before us as well as a great benefit.</p>
               <p>And the effect of this conſideration ſhould be that we be very diligent in fit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting and preparing our ſelves. We are apt to make an ill uſe of it, and that is this, that becauſe there is danger in com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing unworthily, therefore it is the ſafeſt courſe not to come at all. But certainly we never learnt this from the Apoſtle, for he after he had told his <hi>Corinthians</hi> of the danger of unworthy receiving (1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 11.27.) preſently puts them upon examining themſelves and then upon eating this Bread, and drinking this cup, <hi>ver.</hi> 28. We may die by a <hi>famine</hi> as well as by a <hi>ſurfet;</hi> by not <hi>partaking</hi> at <hi>all</hi> as well as by <hi>parta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king amiſs.</hi> He in the parable that came to the Marriage-feaſt without the Wed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding-garment was caſt into outer darkneſs, <hi>Matth.</hi> 22.13. But then for thoſe that were invited and would not come at all, the Lord ſaid that none of thoſe <hi>men</hi> ſhould <hi>taste of his Supper,</hi> Luke 14.24. He that comes unworthily runs into a great danger, and ſo does he that does not come at all. There is but one way of eſcaping the danger, and that is by calling in Gods
<pb n="55" facs="tcp:59207:36"/>help, and a diligent preparing and fitting our ſelves. Which we have great reaſon to do now.</p>
               <p n="3">3. Becauſe we do at this time make a very ſolemn approach to God. We are going to his Table, to be his gueſts, to eat and drink with him. And certainly we had need prepare our ſelves moſt diligent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly did we but rightly conſider this. When we go to the Table of a great man we do trim and ſpruce up our ſelves. It will well become us to come hither with clean hearts, when we conſider that God hath an all-ſeeing eye, and that he cannot en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dure to behold iniquity, God will be ſan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctified by us or upon us. It is no trifling and ſmall matter that we are now about; We make a very near approach unto God, and had need therefore purge our hearts of our uncleanneſs leſt God make a breach upon us. We had need prepare to meet the Lord, and ſanctifie him in our hearts. Let us not dare to trifle in a mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter of ſo great weight, nor to go about to mock God, and impoſe upon him before whom all things are naked and open. Nor let us by any means dare to ſerve God at all adventures, and do ſuch a work as this is negligently and deceitfully. If we do
<pb n="56" facs="tcp:59207:37"/>God will be very far from accepting us or our ſervice.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Wherefore draw nigh to God and he will draw nigh to you. Cleanſe your hands ye ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners, and purifie your hearts ye double-minded,</hi> Jam. 4.8. Here is before us life and death, let us quit our ſelves like men, girding up the Joyns of our mind, and imploring the aid of Heaven that our Souls may live. No leſs than the life of our precious Souls is concerned in this matter. As we do order this affair we may either live or die. Now certainly theſe things that have been named above will be ſufficient to awaken us and provoke us to diligence, if they be but believed and conſidered throughly. Having ſhewed the neceſſity of preparing our ſelves I come now to ſhew how this muſt be done. And firſt I ſhall ſhew what preparations we are to make before we do partake: Secondly what behaviour will become us when we do receive: Thirdly what we muſt do af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter we have received.</p>

               <head>CHAP. IV.</head>
               <p>I Shall now ſhew what preparations we are to make in order to our worthy re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiving of this Sacrament.</p>
               <p>And here I might premiſe, that in ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral and holy life is a very good prepara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive to this ſervice. Were our whole life a life of Religion we ſhould be always in a good readineſs for this ſervice. That which fits us to die fits us to receive this Sacrament of the Lords Supper. And cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainly and holy life is the beſt preparative for death, and therefore it muſt needs be very uſeful and neceſſary to our worthy partaking of the Body and Blood of Chriſt. He that is fit to receive the Sacrament is fit to die; and he that is fit to die is fit to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive the Sacrament; one and the ſame preparation ſerves for both And if an holy life be a good preparative to death, it muſt be ſo for the bleſſed Sacrament alſo. But then though an holy life make a man <hi>habitually</hi> prepared for death, yet
<pb n="58" facs="tcp:59207:38"/>there are for all that ſeveral things adviſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble to the dying man upon his ſick-bed in order to his <hi>actual</hi> preparation for his de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parture hence. And ſo it is in this Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, though an holy life be a good pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parative, yet it is but an habitual one; and it is requiſite that he that leads an ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly life ſhould notwithſtanding that, make an actual preparation before he make his approach to this holy Table. And what we are to do in order to that I ſhall now ſhew.</p>
               <p n="1">1. It is very requiſite we ſhould ſet ſome time apart for this work; that we ſhould ſequeſter ſelves from our worldly affairs and buſineſs, and be at leiſure to attend upon the great concernment of our Souls. But when we are alone we muſt be greatly careful that our worldly thoughts do not thruſt in upon us and divert or diſtract us. We muſt do as <hi>Abraham</hi> did when he ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crificed, and the fowls came down upon his Sacrifice, <hi>he drove them away,</hi> Gen. 15.11. We muſt ſend away our worldly thoughts and cares at this time that they may not diſturb and hinder us, but that we may altogether attend upon that more weighty concern which we are about. If we do not this, we may when we are alone be as much in the World as we are
<pb n="59" facs="tcp:59207:38"/>at any other time. And therefore we ſhall do well not only to ſet ſome time a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>part from our worldly occaſions; but when we have done that we muſt obſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nately reſolve that no worldly thought ſhall get entrance into our hearts at that time. We ſhall be ſure to be ſollicited by our vain thoughts then, but we muſt call in the aid of God, and uſe our utmoſt diligence to keep them out. We muſt empty our ſelves of theſe buyers and ſel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lers, we muſt overturn their Tables of ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>change, and with a great zeal whip theſe thieves out of Gods Temple.</p>
               <p>This perhaps we may think a matter of ſome difficulty; but there is nothing great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly difficult to him that is reſolved; no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing can be ſo to him that humbly and fervently implores the grace and aid of God. Beſides it is for the life of our Souls that we do this: And if we loved our Souls as well as we do our Eſtates or Bodies, and (I might ſay) our ſins, we ſhould not find any difficulty in this mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter. For, for the ſake of theſe things we can ſpend many days and not complain; and therefore have no reaſon to think much of ſpending now and then a day in conſulting the intereſt of our immortal Souls. And ſure I am there are no porti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons
<pb n="60" facs="tcp:59207:39"/>of our time better ſpent than thoſe we ſpend in the diligent ſervice of God, and about the ſecuring the eternal intereſt of our Souls. We ſhall one day wiſh that ſome of thoſe hours which now we care<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſly ſpend in doing nothing, or in doing amiſs, which we ſpend in impertinent vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſits, or in riot and drunkenneſs had been ſpent in our Cloſets, in fervent prayer to Almighty God, and in caring for our pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tious Souls. If ever we would have our Souls do well we muſt ſometimes be alone and ſet apart ſome portion of our time for our ſervice of our God. We have our Savi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ours example for this, though he were much called upon and greatly employed, and that always in doing good to Man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kind, yet he finds time to be alone. And rather than neglect it he will defraud him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf of his Reſt. Thus we are told that he <hi>riſes a great while before day and departs into a ſolitary place, and there prays, Mark</hi> 1.35. He continues in <hi>prayer all night,</hi> Luk. 6.12. And when his Diſciples were aſleep we find him <hi>praying upon his knees,</hi> Luk. 22.41. and <hi>praying more earneſtly,</hi> ver. 44. So that no man may now think himſelf excuſed through the multiplicity of his affairs from his holy ſolitudes and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tirements. Our Bleſſed Lord found time
<pb n="61" facs="tcp:59207:39"/>for theſe things, though he were ſo much called upon to heal the ſick, and help the needy. We muſt then ſeparate our ſelves from the world and from all its cares and pleaſures, and devote our ſelves and our time to the ſervice of God. And as it is adviſeable that we ſhould do this often, ſo is it more eſpecially that we ſhould do it before we approach to the Table of our Lord, that we may be at leiſure to fit our ſelves for ſo great and ſo excellent a ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice.</p>
               <p n="2">2. It is very neceſſary that we ſhould examine and try our ſelves, <hi>Let a manex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>amine himſelf and ſo let him eat, &amp;c.</hi> 1 Cor. 11.28. We muſt deſcend into our own ſouls, and try what we are. This is the duty of every man leſt he bring deſtructi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on upon himſelf. No man is to be too confident of himſelf; he muſt bring him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf to the rule, and meaſure himſelf by that.</p>
               <p>We are very apt to think too well of our ſelves. For we are too forward to judge of our ſelves by an imperfect rule and meaſure; to think our ſelves good be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe we are not ſo bad as the worſt; or to judge well of our ſelves becauſe other men judge well of us; or to acquit our ſelves becauſe our Conſcience does not
<pb n="62" facs="tcp:59207:40"/>condemn us; or perhaps we judge our ſelves in a ſafe condition becauſe we are innocent as to ſome things, and give an hearty obedience to ſome of the Laws of God. Or elſe it may be, that we think our ſelves in a ſafe condition becauſe we mean well though we do not al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways do as we ſhould do. We are ready to call our great ſins little ones, and our little ones none at all. Or elſe we think our ſelves ſafe becauſe we are, as we think, of an orthodox belief, or of a more refi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned ſect or party of men. A great many ways there are by which we may deceive our ſelves, and miſcarry eternally. And therefore we had need uſe a moſt ſevere ſcrutiny and ſearch. For our hearts are deceitful and deſperately wicked, and do eaſily impoſe upon us. 'Twas a wiſe ſpeech of one of the <hi>Jews, That a man ſhould not put any trust in himſelf as long as he lives.</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Hillel. Avoth. c. <hi>2.</hi> S. <hi>4.</hi>
                  </note> And King <hi>So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lomon</hi> tells us, that <hi>all the ways of a man are clean in his own eyes, but the Lord weigheth the Spirits,</hi> Prov. 16.2. We do eaſily abſolve our ſelves; for we are partial, and greatly favourable to our own ſide. We are often heard to ſay, that indeed we are <hi>great Sinners,</hi> but then
<pb n="63" facs="tcp:59207:40"/>we add that we <hi>repent.</hi> That we do not <hi>keep the Law</hi> we do confeſs, but then we profeſs to <hi>believe the Goſpel.</hi> We have <hi>done amiſs</hi> we ſay, but then we do de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clare that we will be <hi>more heedful</hi> for the time to come: We have <hi>quarrell'd with our Neighbours</hi> indeed, but yet we do give out that we <hi>forgive them.</hi> We have <hi>not done</hi> as <hi>we ſhould,</hi> but yet we affirm that we <hi>deſire</hi> to be <hi>better.</hi> But all this while it is a great queſtion whether our Repentance, and Faith, our Charity, and purpoſes of amendment, and deſires of becoming better be ſincere or not.</p>
               <p>For all this while we are ſuppoſed not to have examined our ſelves; for when we come to do that by the unalterable Law of God we may perhaps find our ſins great, and Repentance leſs than now we conceive it to be. If we try our purpoſes of amendment, our Charity and Faith, and deſires of becoming better, we may not find them to be that which we would have them be thought to be. It will be well for us therefore that we examine and prove our ſelves, as the Apoſtle requires we ſhould, leſt we deceive our ſelves
<pb n="64" facs="tcp:59207:41"/>for ever when we take up with that which is counterfeit and inſincere. We are eaſily perſwaded to do this when our Eſtates or Lives are concerned; In that caſe we love to take a ſure courſe, and to ſearch into the bottom of the thing. 'Twere well for us we were as curious where our Souls are ſo nearly concern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed. We ſhall find it worth our while to examine and try our ſelves. And I ſhall ſhew what things they are which we are to examine in order to the fitting our ſelves for the Supper of the Lord; and the right underſtanding what will become us in ſo weighty an affair.</p>

               <head>CHAP. V.</head>
               <p>THE firſt thing that we are to exa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mine is what we have done amiſs, and what we have omitted. We are o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bliged to conſider our ways and to look back upon our lives and converſations, and obſerve wherein we have tranſgreſſed the holy laws of God. We muſt make a diligent ſearch into our hearts and moſt carefully reflect upon our lives paſt. And for the better ſucceſs of this work we may take theſe following rules.</p>
               <p n="1">1. We muſt be greatly careful that we be not remiſs and careleſs in this ſearch: That we do not ſearch for our ſins as ſome negligent officers ſearch for offenders, whom they have no mind to find out. But as the <hi>Jews</hi> were very curious in ſearching for leaven, and as the Prieſt was obliged to be very exact in ſearching after the Le<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proſie that did ariſe in a man or houſe, ſo muſt we be. We muſt ſearch narrowly,
<pb n="66" facs="tcp:59207:42"/>as the faithful Phyſician does by his Pati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent whoſe health he does conſult. He does curiouſly obſerve the nature of his diſeaſe, all the moments of its riſe and growth, its ſymptoms, and its types, that he may know how to help nature, and counterwork the diſeaſe. Or as a faithful and skilful workman that would uphold a decaying houſe, he ſearches diligently in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to its ſeveral parts, examines the founda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, conſiders its ſides and ſuperſtructures, that he may obviate and prevent its fall. So muſt we do, we muſt deſcend into eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry corner of our hearts, look very dili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gently over our lives, and well conſider our wayes that we may find out what is amiſs in us. The intereſt of our Souls is greatly concerned, if we leave any ſin which we might have found out, our con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition is full of danger. A little leaven leavens the whole lump; and therefore it concerns us highly to be very exact in our ſearch.</p>
               <p n="2">2. We muſt be careful that we make this ſearch by the light of Gods Law. The <hi>Jews</hi> require when men ſearch for leaven againſt the Paſſover,<note place="margin">Peſach. c. <hi>1.</hi> S. <hi>1.</hi>
                  </note> that they ſhould do it by the <hi>light of a Candle.</hi> We had not need be in the dark when we go about ſuch a work as this is,
<pb n="67" facs="tcp:59207:42"/>and we had need have a clearer light than that of our own Conſciences is. The Law of God is an unerring rule; by this we muſt try and ſearch our ſelves. And therefore we had need know this Law or elſe we ſhall not be able to judge our ſelves by it, and conſequently very unfit to ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proach unto the Table of our Lord. By this Law we may find out what we have done amiſs. This glaſs will diſcover our ſpots. And though we may think our ſelves very innocent, yet upon our trial we ſhall find many things amiſs.</p>
               <p>For the Commandment is exceeding broad; we are very apt to ſay with the man in the Goſpel, <hi>all theſe things have we kept from our youth up,</hi> Matth. 19.20. But we conſider not how far the Law of God ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tends and reaches. We are commanded <hi>to have no other gods before the Lord our God.</hi> We perhaps are ready to think that we do not break this Law till we fall down and worſhip ſome new Deity. But we are much deceived in this. For by this precept we are obliged to love God above all things, to pray to him, fear him, truſt in him, give him thanks, and in all things to prefer him above all the things of this preſent World. And therefore if we find our ſelves devoid of the love of
<pb n="68" facs="tcp:59207:43"/>God, or (which is all one) full of the love of this World and of our ſins; if we find we love or fear, or truſt in any thing more than in him; that we do not give him hearty thanks for his mercies, nor yet heartily pray for his grace and aſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance, we may certainly conclude that we are offenders againſt the Law of God. We are commanded that we <hi>ſhould not kill:</hi> Now not only he that ſheds his brothers blood but he that hates him, and cenſures him is guilty of a breach of this Law. <hi>He that hates his brother is a murderer,</hi> 1 Joh. 3.15. Again, when we are forbidden <hi>Adultery</hi> we are guilty when we look on a Woman to luſt after her.</p>
               <p>For the Law as was ſaid afore, is ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeding broad. It does not only oblige the outward but the inward man; It does not only forbid us to <hi>do</hi> but alſo to <hi>think</hi> any evil. When it commands a duty it muſt be ſuppoſed to require all thoſe things which are the means that lead us to it. And when it forbids a ſin it muſt be thought to forbid whatever would induce us to it. We have reaſon to think our ſelves guilty not only when we do direct<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly break the letter of the Law, but when we tranſgreſs againſt the inward and ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritual meaning of it. We are guilty not
<pb n="69" facs="tcp:59207:43"/>only when we commit a ſin our ſelves but when we make others to ſin, nay when we do not reprove and hinder others when we can. There are many wayes by which we become tranſgreſſors. And there is no better way to find out our ini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quity than by comparing our lives with the Law of God.</p>
               <p>If thoſe men did but carefully do this, who now pride themſelves as better than their neighbours, they might find very foul ſpots where as now they think all their wayes clean. This would ſhew them thoſe faults which their pride and luſt will not now let them ſee. Our Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience is many times but an imperfect light, and is always ſo when 'tis not en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lightned from the Law of God. 'Tis that Rule by which we are to meaſure our ſelves. And therefore if we would find our ſin let us take this light to direct and guide us in our ſearch.</p>
               <p n="3">3. We muſt be very particular in this ſearch. That we are ſinners we may ea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſily find, but we muſt not ſatisfie our ſelves in this, but muſt find out our par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular ſins which we are guilty of. For if in order to our pardon we muſt confeſs and forſake our ſins, we had need find them out; if we do not do this it is not
<pb n="70" facs="tcp:59207:44"/>like we ſhould confeſs them and forſake them. For how can we be thought to confeſs and forſake thoſe ſins which we are ignorant of? And if we do not this what hopes can we have of pardon?</p>
               <p>Indeed where we cannot by our utmoſt ſearch find out every ſin, we may yet hope for pardon if we humbly and penitently beg it with the <hi>Pſalmist,</hi> who prays to God to <hi>cleanſe him from his ſecret faults,</hi> Pſal. 19.12. But this we may hope when we cannot find out our particular ſin; when we can do that, we muſt know it is our duty to do it in order to our con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſion and our parton.<note place="margin">In which the Reader may be aſſiſted by the heads of ſelf-ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>amination at the cloſe of the Book called the <hi>Whole duty of Man.</hi>
                  </note> And a thing very advi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſable it is, that we ſhould have ready by us at ſuch times as this a moſt parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular Catalogue of our ſins, and that we do in our private prayers as particularly confeſs them to God. It is very eaſie and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon to confeſs our ſelves ſinners to God, but there is a great cheat in that general confeſſion, and if we would have pardon we muſt be more particular.</p>
               <p n="4">4. We muſt not only make a particular ſearch after our ſins, but we muſt alſo well conſider of the degrees and aggravations
<pb n="71" facs="tcp:59207:44"/>of them. For all ſins are not alike. There are many circumſtances that do encreaſe our guilt, and therefore if we would not hide our fault, we muſt ſearch after theſe things.</p>
               <p>Now there are ſeveral things which do greatly enhance our guilt, and make our ſins more exceeding ſinful, that give them a deeper dye and ſtain. Now every ſin is a tranſgreſſion againſt the Law of God, but yet there are ſome ſins which are more hainous than others;</p>
               <p n="1">1. As for example, when our ſin is ſuch as is not only againſt the Law of God but againſt our own <hi>Conſcience</hi> alſo; when we know the Law and our Conſcience does make a faithful report of it, and yet we will commit it. <hi>He that knows his Masters will and doth it not ſhall be beaten with many ſtripes.</hi> This is no ſmall aggravation of our guilt when we <hi>rebel againſt the light. This rebellion is as the ſin of witchcraft.</hi> We have no manner of excuſe left us in this caſe, and therefore ought to humble our ſelves greatly under ſuch ſins as theſe are.</p>
               <p n="2">2. Again when we are <hi>vincibly</hi> and <hi>cul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pably ignorant,</hi> and bribe or blind our Conſciences, our guilt is alſo greatly aggra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vated. Perhaps we will not know our
<pb n="72" facs="tcp:59207:45"/>duty that we may not be though obliged to do it. Or we have certain arts to bribe our Conſciences, or have found out ways to ſtop their ſentence. This is a moſt hai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nous aggravation of our guilt, and comes up very near to that which was named laſt. He is not only a very wicked ſervant that refuſes to do what he hears his Maſter com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand him, but he is alſo very wicked that ſtops his ears, and will give no heed to what he does command him. The one <hi>rebells againſt</hi> the <hi>light,</hi> and the other <hi>ſhuts</hi> it <hi>out.</hi> The one will <hi>not admit</hi> the <hi>truth,</hi> when the other will <hi>not obey</hi> it, but detains it in unrighteouſneſs. There are no men ſo deplorably blind as they that will not ſee. 'Tis to be feared there is too much of this abroad in the World. Men are a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fraid of the light and therefore they run away from it. And are therefore like the old <hi>Turk</hi> we read of, who being conſcious that by his Law he ought not to drink any Wine was yet reſolved to drink it, and ſo he did, but before he drank he gave ſome great ſhouts; <hi>which he did,</hi> as he ſaid, <hi>to give his Conſcience warning that it might ſtand away,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Buſbequii Legat. Turc. Ep. <hi>1.</hi>
                  </note> 
                  <hi>and not be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hold his wickedneſs, nor be guil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty of it.</hi> Certainly too many men take this courſe or elſe they could ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver
<pb n="73" facs="tcp:59207:45"/>do what now they do. They diſmiſs their Conſciences when they would inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe. And find out ways either to keep them from <hi>ſpeaking,</hi> or elſe from <hi>being heard.</hi> But whoever hath uſed theſe arts hath contracted a great guilt.</p>
               <p n="3">3. Another great aggravation of our guilt is that we have ſinned after <hi>Vows</hi> of better obedience. And there is ſomething of this to be found in every ſin we com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit; for it is committed againſt our <hi>Bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſmal Vow</hi> when we did moſt ſolemnly de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vote our ſelves to the ſervice of God in op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſition to the Devil, the World, and the Fleſh. And many of us have made the ſame Vow again upon a bed of ſick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, in times of danger, or when we did partake of the Supper of our Lord. And to relapſe after all this does greatly in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creaſe our guilt. We are very wretched ſinners if we break theſe <hi>bands aſunder, and cast away theſe cords from us.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="4">4. But ſtill our ſins are again the great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er when they are committed and continu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed in after the ſingular and eminent <hi>mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cies</hi> of <hi>God</hi> towards us, which <hi>lead us to Repentance,</hi> Rom. 2.4. For now we add the greateſt <hi>ingratitude</hi> to our other guilt, and do by that fill up the meaſure of our iniquity. And there is no man
<pb n="74" facs="tcp:59207:46"/>living but may eaſily find this aggravati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on in his ſins. For certain it is, however we complain of our miſeries and needs, we are encompaſſed about with the mercies of Heaven. And there is no man living ſo miſerable or wretched but if he would but conſider and reflect, would eaſily find this to be a truth. Certainly the hopes that we ſtill have of Heaven, and the means of grace are moſt unſpeakable mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cies. But beſides, if we look back, we may find many other ſingular mercies of God towards us which do upbraid us for our great unthankfulneſs. He hath many times kept our Souls from death, our eyes from tears, and our feet from falling. He hath long waited for our return, who might long ago have placed us among the dead and damned; which is a plain de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monſtration that God hath been greatly kind unto us, and ſo far from deſiring our death that he ſhewed himſelf (when we did chuſe the paths that lead to death) deſirous that we ſhould turn and live.</p>
               <p n="5">5. That our ſins are committed under the <hi>means</hi> of <hi>grace</hi> is ſtill a farther aggra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation of our guilt. The Goſpel hath provided us ſufficient help and aſſiſtance to do the will of God. If we do amiſs it is becauſe we will not uſe the means which
<pb n="75" facs="tcp:59207:46"/>God hath offered us that we might become better. There is a ſufficient aid at hand if we will make uſe of it. The Goſpel does not only require our obedience but alſo enables us to obey. If we do but humbly beg the holy Spirit of God, and do it but as earneſtly as the hungry child will beg bread of his Father, we ſhall as certainly receive this heavenly aid, <hi>Luk.</hi> 11.13. This Spirit <hi>will help our infirmities,</hi> Rom. 8.26. And if he dwell in our hearts we ſhall find him that <hi>is in us grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter than he that is in the world,</hi> 1 Joh. 4.4. Now certainly we are very fond of our ſins, if we will not do our utmoſt to get rid of them. The way is eaſie and plain before us; we may be better if we will not make light of the aid and aſſiſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance of Heaven. Our freedom from ſin is purchaſed by our Lord, and offered us in the Goſpel, if we accept it not upon ſuch eaſie terms we deſerve to be ſlaves for ever. 'Twill be but juſt we ſhould be uſed as the ſervant under the Law, who might have his liberty and refuſed it; he was made a publick ſhame for his great folly in refuſing to go free, when his freedom was offered him: (For that is thought to be the meaning of what followed upon his
<pb n="76" facs="tcp:59207:47"/>refuſal), for his Maſter carried him a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way to the Judges, and at the gate of the houſe or court of Juſtice, he bored through his ear with an awl, and he was at once marked and condemned to be a ſervant for ever, <hi>Exod.</hi> 21.6. It is no little aggravation of our crime that we do amiſs when we have ſuch advantages of being and doing better.</p>
               <p n="6">6. That we continue in our ſins not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withſtanding the very <hi>ſevere afflictions</hi> which God hath ſent upon us to wean us from them is another conſideration that does heighten our guilt. Nay we ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny times commit our ſin when Gods hand is ſtriking us, we little regard the diſcipline of Heaven; when his judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments are upon us yet we will not learn Righteouſneſs. There is a mark ſet up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on <hi>Ahaz</hi> for this, <hi>In the time of his diſtreſs did he yet treſpaſs more against the Lord. This is that King Ahaz,</hi> 2 Chron. 28.22. This was a moſt hainous impiety, and that which very greatly increaſed his crimes.</p>
               <p n="7">7. Again, another thing which adds a weight to our guilt is this, when we re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lapſe frequently into thoſe very ſins which we have formerly confeſſed to God, and
<pb n="77" facs="tcp:59207:47"/>begged his pardon for. When we do con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſs and ſin again, and keep in this black circle of the Devil. In this we do mock Almighty God, and may well be aſhamed to lift up our eyes to Heaven if we well conſider it. In our dealings with one another we eſteem that man void of all ingenuity that begs our pardon, that he hath offended us, and yet holds on to do us the ſame deſpites and injuries. How horribly diſingenuous are we then when we daily put affronts theſe upon God him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf, when we do often confeſs but never forſake our ſins.</p>
               <p n="8">8. Another aggravation of our guilt is when we continue in thoſe ſins which we have no temptation to commit, and might moſt eaſily avoid. Such are generally the ſins of the tongue; there is no natural de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſire that is gratified by ſwearing, or by evil ſpeaking, and ſlandering one another. Theſe are indeed moſt hainous offences againſt Almighty God; and their guilt is the greater becauſe there is nothing of temptation to commit them, and they are moſt eaſily avoided whatever the ſinner may plead for himſelf. Certain it is a man may as eaſily bleſs God as take his name in vain. To ſpeak well of our neighbour
<pb n="78" facs="tcp:59207:48"/>is as ſoon done as to ſpeak amiſs. A good word coſts us no more pains than a bad one. And what wretched ſinners are we who chuſe to do amiſs when it is as eaſie for us to do well; and certainly ſo it is in many caſes.</p>
               <p n="9">9. Another aggravation of our ſin is when we have not only ſinned our ſelves but cauſed others to ſin too. This brand was upon <hi>Jeroboam</hi> that he did not only ſin himſelf, but alſo cauſed <hi>Iſrael</hi> to ſin. Certainly our own ſcores will be great enough, we ſhall not need have the ſins of others to account for beſides. It will well become us to conſider of this when we ſearch into our hearts and lives; whether we have not by our <hi>counſel</hi> or <hi>example,</hi> by our <hi>neglect</hi> and <hi>unfaithfulneſs</hi> cauſed others to go aſtray; who might have been pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerved from the errour of their way had we been faithful to them in our reproofs and exhortations.</p>
               <p n="10">10. Laſtly, another degree of our ſin is when it is come to an <hi>habit</hi> or <hi>cuſtom.</hi> And this does ſtill make our ſin the greater; for now our ſin is grown up to a full mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure and to the higheſt ſtature and pitch, and then we may well reckon our ſelves to be not only ſinners; but workers of iniquity.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="79" facs="tcp:59207:48"/>It is very adviſable that we ſhould con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſider of theſe Agrravations of our ſins in order to the more full humiliation of our Souls before God. It is very needful that thoſe things which do greatly encreaſe our guilt ſhould be particularly confeſſed and lamented in the ſight of God. Now it is very evident that the particular above-named do very much heighten and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creaſe our guilt.</p>
               <p>Indeed every ſinner, does tranſgreſs the Law of God, that Law which is holy, juſt, and good, for ſin is the Tranſgreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion of the Law. But then he that ſins againſt the clear dictates of his own <hi>Conſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence</hi> alſo, contracts a double guilt; he that ſins after his ſolemn vows of obedience, adds <hi>treachery</hi> to his other guilt; and he that ſins after many mercies, adds <hi>ingrati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tude</hi> to his other ſins; every ſin makes us obnoxious to Gods diſpleaſure, but yet are there many degrees in our ſins which do greatly aggravate our fault, and intro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duce a new and greater guilt upon us. And certainly to abound in ſin under the greateſt means of grace; to continue in our folly when the rod of God lies heavy upon us; to commit the ſin which it is ſo very eaſie to avoid; to repeat our ſin
<pb n="80" facs="tcp:59207:49"/>when we have confeſſed and bewailed it, to ſin and to cauſe others to ſin alſo; to contract habits and cuſtoms of evil doing; theſe are things which are by no means to be forgotten in our ſearch becauſe they do import ſo much of guilt, and ſo great a degree of wickedneſs.</p>
               <p>But all that hath been ſaid is but rela<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive to ſomething elſe; we are not fit to receive the Sacrament as ſoon as we have found out our ſins. The <hi>Jews</hi> were not only obliged to <hi>ſearch</hi> for their Leaven at the Paſſover, but alſo to <hi>purge</hi> it out. And their ſearch was in order to their putting it away. They might not leave it where they found it, but were obliged to put it from them; we muſt do ſo by our ſins too; and therefore we muſt now conſider what we are obliged to do in the next place.</p>

               <p>WHen we are gone thus far, and have found out our ſins we muſt then put them away by a true and hearty Repentance. Unleſs we do this we ſhall eat and drink Damnation to our ſelves. Now becauſe, though Repentance be ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry commonly pretended to, yet we do often miſtake our ſelves in it, and take that for it which comes far ſhort of it; therefore it is very neceſſary we ſhould examine our Repentance, and very care<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully try whether it be ſuch as is never to be repented of. For as it is very common with men to think they <hi>have not ſinned</hi> when <hi>they have,</hi> ſo it is very common with men to think they <hi>have not ſinned</hi> when <hi>they have,</hi> ſo it is alſo as uſual a thing with them to conceit that they <hi>have repent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed</hi> when indeed they <hi>have not.</hi> For we are too apt to think Repentance no more but a calling to God for mercy, or a ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral confeſſion that we are ſinners, or ſome ſudden purpoſes of amendment of
<pb n="82" facs="tcp:59207:50"/>Life, or at moſt the actual abſtaining from our ſin. Therefore it will be worth our while that we examine our Repentance, and that we may do by the following Rules.</p>
               <p n="1">1. He that Repents is greatly ſorrowful for his ſin. He is inwardly grieved that he ſhould offend God by his ſins; and would rather chuſe any loſs or trouble than commit his ſin again. His ſorrow is very hearty and unfained; he is grieved in earneſt, and his grief is great accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to the meaſure and proportion of his ſin and folly. He is vile and baſe in his own eyes, and is greatly afflicted for his wickedneſs. Indeed the ſincerity of his ſorrow is not altogether to be meaſured by his tears which he ſheds: For though tears be reputed the expreſſion of our grief, yet are they but the expreſſion of it: Grief does many times break out this way; But yet a man may be greatly for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rowful when the greatneſs of his grief can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not be gathered from the multitude of his tears. Some there are who do eaſily weep, a very trifling matter will draw forth plen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty of tears. But there are others who <hi>grieve more</hi> and yet <hi>weep leſs.</hi> But then it
<pb n="83" facs="tcp:59207:50"/>is ſtill an ill ſign if when we have tears for every little trouble, we have none for ou<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap> ſins. We read of one <hi>Alexander Pheraeus</hi> that he was ready to weep at the acting a Tragedy,<note place="margin">Plutarch. Pelopidas.</note> and that he left the Stage that the Specta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tors might not behold his tears: But then we alſo read of the ſame man that he ſhed the blood of many <hi>Theſſalian</hi> Nobles with dry cheeks. Such falſe tears had that Ty<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rant at his command. Certainly we may well ſuſpect our ſelves when we can find none at all for our hainous offences againſt God. For it may be reaſonably thought, that if our grief were hearty and pungent which we have for our ſins, it would break out at the ſame vent which it is wont to find upon all other occaſions. Certain it is however that the true Peni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent is a very ſorrowful man; and though his temper may not give way to plenty of tears, yet his real grief is not the leſs. Though he do not weep ſo plentifully, yet he grieves as heartily as he that doth. He does afflict himſelf for his ſin, he judges and condemns himſelf, and feels as much pain in his Soul, and as cordial a ſorrow
<pb n="84" facs="tcp:59207:51"/>as he that weeps bitterly.</p>
               <p n="2">2. He that truly repents does confeſs his ſins unto God. And this he muſt do in order to his pardon, <hi>If we confeſs our ſins he is faithful and juſt to forgive us our ſins, &amp;c,</hi> 1 Joh. 1.9. But then this confeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion alone does not bring us nearer our par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don, we muſt confeſs them with ſhame and ſorrow; we muſt judge and condemn our ſelves; and after the moſt humble manner debaſe our ſelves, and beg pardon from God. Our confeſſion muſt be very humble and very full. We muſt be par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular in it, and not content our ſelves that we confeſs our ſelves to be ſinners in general, but we muſt confeſs our particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar ſins unto God. We muſt confeſs all the ſins we can find, all that we can re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>member: And then for thoſe which we cannot find, or do not remember, it will be needful that we ſhould pray alſo for the pardon of them as the <hi>Pſalmiſt</hi> does, <hi>Cleanſe thou me from ſecret faults,</hi> Pſal. 19.12. And as we muſt confeſs our ſins, ſo we muſt alſo confeſs the degrees and the aggra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vations of them; for theſe do greatly in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hance our guilt and ſwell our ſins into a very great meaſure. But all this while we muſt be very greatly careful that our con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſion
<pb n="85" facs="tcp:59207:51"/>be the reſult of our real ſorrow and trouble of heart. God will not be put off with a parcel of good words. If we do not abhor our ſins it will not avail us that we do confeſs them. God knows our ſins already, nor is he pleaſed to hear us re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peat them to him unleſs we hate them, and be really preſſed with the burden of them. 'Tis the burdened ſinner whom God hath a reſpect unto: He that is full of his ſor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>row for his ſin, 'tis he that confeſſes his ſin as he ought; ſuch a man finds the ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantage of an humble confeſſion of his ſin unto God. For this gives a great eaſe to his Soul, which would have been over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>charged if he ſhould have kept ſilence. This the <hi>Pſalmiſt</hi> tells us, <hi>When I kept ſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lence,</hi> ſays he, <hi>my bones waxed old,</hi>—<hi>and my moſture is turned into the drought of ſummer.</hi> But then he adds, <hi>I acknowledged my ſin unto thee, and mine iniquity have I not hid. I ſaid, I will confeſs my tranſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greſſions unto the Lord; and thou forgaveſt the iniquity of my ſin.</hi> And then we find him greatly at eaſe and quiet, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 32.3, 4, 5, 6, 7.</p>
               <p n="3">3. He that truly repents does forſake his ſins and lead a new life: He does not only purpoſe but he really does that good
<pb n="86" facs="tcp:59207:52"/>which he did intend to do. He does not lead ſuch a life as he did before. He ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtains from the ſin which he formerly lov<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed and followed. Nor does he only ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtain from it, but he does abhor it, and ſo he does every ſin whatever; and gives up himſelf to an univerſal obedience to all the Laws of God. We have no reaſon to think we have repented till we lead a new and an holy Life. 'Tis this which com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pleats our Repentance, and nothing ſhort of this can give us any aſſurance that we have Repented, and that we are in the ſtate of Grace. It is a vain thing to think that we are the better for purpoſes of a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mendment when we do not amend. If we purpoſe never ſo much to do well and yet continue in our evil doing we ſhall be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>puted amongſt the workers of iniquity. Repentance imports a change both of heart and life. It requires a new life and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſation, and where there is this grace there is this change to be found. The Holy Scriptures annex our pardon to our Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pentance, but then they require ſuch a Repentance as does import no leſs than a new life and converſation. Thus we find in the Prophet how the Repentance of a Sinner is expreſſed, <hi>If he turn from his ſin,
<pb n="87" facs="tcp:59207:52"/>and do that which is lawful and right; if the wicked reſtore the pledg, give again that he had robbed, walk in the ſtatutes of life with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out committing iniquity; he ſhall ſurely live he ſhall not die,</hi> Ezek. 33.14, 15. Again, <hi>If the wicked will turn from all his ſins that he hath committed, and keep all my ſtatutes, and do that which is lawful and right, he ſhall ſurely live and not die,</hi> Chap. 18. <hi>ver.</hi> 21. And when the ſinner is called upon to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pent we find it thus expreſſed, <hi>Seek the Lord while he may be found, call ye upon him while he is near; let the wicked forſake his way, and the unrighteous man his thoughts, and let him return unto the Lord,</hi> Iſa. 55.6, 7. By which it is evident that Repentance implies a change of Life, and ſo indeed it does. That man that reſolves to do well and does not do it, does at once mock God and cheat his own Soul.</p>
               <p n="4">4. He that truly repents, his Repen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance does ariſe from his love to God, and an hatred to his ſins becauſe they are an offence to God. This is the root from whence Repentance does ſpring.</p>
               <p>The love of God conſtrains the Sinner to Repentance; and his love to God it is that makes his Repentance of the right kind and ſtamp. It is very poſſible that a
<pb n="88" facs="tcp:59207:53"/>man may be greatly ſorrowful upon the account of his ſins, and that he may make a particular confeſſion of them to God, and when he hath done that he may for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſake his ſins too, and yet not have the grace of true Repentance all this while. And that becauſe this change does not a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſe from a love to God and an hatred of his ſin as it is an offence againſt God. A man may be very ſorrowful for his ſins be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe they have brought a great miſery upon him, and do beſides expoſe him to the juſtice of God. Such a man is ſorrow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful for the ill conſequence of his ſin rather than for its obliquity and immorality. And perhaps he forſakes his ſin too and yet is no true Penitent. For he may leave his ſin for many reaſons and yet not repent of it. A bare abſtaining from ſin is no ſuffici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent argument that he hath repented of it. A man may forbear his ſin and abſtain from it becauſe he cannot follow it, or hath not the liberty to enjoy it any longer, and yet his mind remains unchanged ſtill; or elſe perhaps he exchanges one ſin for another, and chuſes a ſin which he judges moſt expedient. But the true Penitent abtains from his ſin becauſe he loves his God. Nay, he does not only abſtain
<pb n="89" facs="tcp:59207:53"/>from his ſin but he hates it alſo.</p>
               <p>The reaſon why he leaves his ſin is be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe he is himſelf changed in his mind and affections: He now hates what he loved before, and flies from that which before he did purſue. He ſees his folly as well as his miſery, and leaves his ſin, not only becauſe God is juſt, and will ſeverely pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſh the wicked, but becauſe he is good and holy, and cannot endure to behold iniquity. He abſtains from his ſin not on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly becauſe it is forbidden fruit, but be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe it is contrary to his nature. He that is not in the ſtate of Grace may abſtain from his ſin as a ſick man does from ſalt meats (which yet he greatly loves) be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe his Phyſician and his intereſt ſevere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly forbid him: But the true Penitent for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bears his ſin becauſe he finds in his Soul an antipathy againſt it; and not only be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe it is forbidden.</p>
               <p>Such a Repentance as this muſt we find in our Souls before we can be fit to par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>take of theſe holy Myſteries. And well it will become us to be greatly humbled for our ſins, and to abhor them when we do commemorate the death of our Lord and Saviour. For he died for ſin, and endured the ſhame and ſorrow of the Croſs that he
<pb n="90" facs="tcp:59207:54"/>might no longer abide in us. And if we come with our ſins to this holy Table we do crucifie our Lord afreſh, we do tram<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple upon his precious blood, and count it a common and unholy thing.</p>
               <p n="5">5. To what hath been ſaid this muſt be added, that when by our ſin we have not only offended God but alſo injured and wronged our neighbour, we are ſtrictly and indiſpenſably obliged to make him reſtitution, as well as to beg the forgiveneſs of God. We can expect no pardon from God if we do not make amends to our neighbour whom we have wronged. <hi>If the wicked reſtore the pledge, and give again that he had robbed, &amp;c, he ſhall ſurely live and not die,</hi> Ezek. 33.15. But then if he do not this (or ſincerely reſolve to do it aſſoon as he is able to do it) he ſhall ſurely die and not live. And his partaking of this holy Table ſhall be ſo far from ſaving him from the anger of God, that it will encreaſe his guilt and add to his ſin. Let no man think that God will hear him if he do not make his brother amends for the wrong he hath done him.<note place="margin">Herodot.

Nay the day of expiation (as the <hi>Jews</hi> teach us) would not avail to take away the guilt which we contracted by doing wrong to our brother.</p>
               <p>And we muſt remember that we are obliged to make reſtitution not only where we have done an open and forcible injury: As the robber and thief, and vio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent oppreſſor are bound to reſtore what they have wrong'd their brother of by their violent injuſtice. But we are alſo obliged to reſtore what we have by any means unjuſtly got the poſſeſſion of. And there are more ways than one by which we may become guilty of injuſtice. He that overreaches, and out-wits his brother in a bargain, he that in his trading deals frau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dulently
<pb n="93" facs="tcp:59207:55"/>and inſincerely, he that hides and conceals from his neighbour his juſt rights and dues, ſuch men as theſe are obli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged to make reſtitution as well as open the robber and the thief. There are indeed very many things which the Laws of the Land do not take notice of, which yet we are obliged to in the Court of Conſcience. And we are before we do receive this Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crament, very ſeverely to examine our own Conſciences; Whether in our deal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings with men we have done as we would be done by, and have not detained and with-held our neighbours due from him. Indeed we are come to that paſs that we are not afraid of doing an unjuſt action if we can but do it cautelouſly and ſlily. Nay we are ready to rejoyce when we have cunningly circumvented our bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, and men look upon it as but a little fault, if any at all, when they do craf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tily circumvent even him that attends upon holy things. But certain it is, who<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever does wrong his brother and him that Miniſters at Gods Altar, he deceives him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf moſt, and muſt never look for pardon from God till he have repented of his ſin and made reſtitution for the wrong he hath done.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="94" facs="tcp:59207:56"/>And what hath been ſaid hitherto of the neceſſity of making reſtitution muſt not only be underſtood of the wrong we have done to our neighbour as to his goods and eſtate, but of all other wrongs whatſoever. And particularly of that wrong we have done to his name and credit. We ought to judge the beſt of all men, and to make the moſt charitable conſtruction of all the actions of our neighbour: And therefore if we have done otherwiſe we are obliged to Repen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance, and to reſtitution for the wrong which we have done. If we have openly ſlandered our brother, or more cloſely and ſlily undermined his credit and good name, we are obliged in this caſe to make as far as we are able a reparation. That is, we are obliged to unſay what we have ſaid, and by our words do him honour as we have endeavoured before to do him a diſcredit. In a word, we are bound to make him ſuch an amends as we are able, or ſuch as may ſatisfie him to whom we have done the wrong. And when we have done this we muſt humble our ſelves greatly in the ſight of God for this ſin, and be very careful that we ſin no more.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="95" facs="tcp:59207:56"/>Thus muſt we cleanſe and purge our Souls before we dare to come to this holy Table. We muſt purge out our old lea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven that we may be a new lump: O<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therwiſe we ſhall meet with death there where we might elſe have found Life. And we ought therefore to be very care<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful and ſolicitous, leſt we ſhould by our remiſneſs and hypocriſie expoſe our ſelves to the greateſt curſe. As we love our Souls then we muſt not only find out our ſin, but we muſt put it away alſo; and before we preſume to eat of this Bread and drink of this Cup, we muſt find in our Souls ſuch a repentance as is never to be repented of.</p>

               <head>CHAP. VII.</head>
               <p>BUT as we muſt come to this Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment with a ſincere and hearty Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pentance for our paſt ſins, ſo we muſt alſo come with full purpoſes and reſolutions of Amendment of Life for the time to come. Now becauſe our Reſolution like our Repentance, is many times weak and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſignificant, it will therefore well become us to examine theſe purpoſes, and reſolu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions of newneſs of life, which we ſo fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently pretend, when we make our ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proaches to this holy Table. For it is very evident that there are very many men that give good words, and make fair pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſes of Amendment of Life, upon the bed of ſickneſs, or at the approach of this Sacrament, who yet are ſo far from mak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing their words good, that they do ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times run into a greater exceſs of folly and wickedneſs than they were guilty of be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore. We ſhall therefore do well to try our purpoſes and reſolutions, and nar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rowly
<pb n="97" facs="tcp:59207:57"/>to examine them whether they be ſuch as are like to hold or not, and to that purpoſe we may conſider the following Severals.</p>
               <p n="1">1. We have little reaſon to give credit to raſh and ſudden purpoſes of Amend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of Life. The ſinner does now and then reſolve vehemently againſt his ſin; but it is when he hath newly ſurfeited up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on his folly, and defiled himſelf with his ſin; then indeed he is ſick of it for a while, and reſolves to lay it aſide. Or perhaps ſome great and amazing affliction falls up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on him, and this brings his ſin to remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brance, and he ſuddenly reſolves he will put away his ſin and lead a new life; but when this tempeſt of ſorrow is over, and his appetite returns anew upon him, he does eaſily embrace his folly again, and is as much the child of Satan as he was be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore. Such a man is troubled at the miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chief which his folly hath betray'd him to, and is ſick of his ſin for a while becauſe he hath taſted of the bitterneſs which did at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend it. But when he hath forgotten the trouble and the pain his ſin hath put him to, then he returns to it again. There are thoſe in the world that do frequently re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolve
<pb n="98" facs="tcp:59207:58"/>againſt their ſins, and yet do as con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtantly commit thoſe very ſins which they ſo paſſionately reſolve againſt; and that becauſe it was not their ſins which gave them ſo much trouble but the evil effects and conſequents which did follow upon them. For when their ſin courts them and ſmiles upon them, when it follows them officiouſly, and pleads for a reconcilement they readily yield themſelves up to their ſlavery again.</p>
               <p n="2">2. We have little reaſon to truſt to that reſolution which we have formerly found ſo very ineffectual. If we find that we have often reſolved as much as now we do a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt our ſins, and yet that for all that when the ſolemnity hath been over we have forfeited our good promiſes, we have very little reaſon to truſt our ſelves. That man who hath been often a partaker of this Sacrament, and hath as often made his reſolves to become better, and as often broken them, hath no reaſon to believe himſelf, nor to communicate again till he find a change in himſelf. For it is to be ſuſpected that ſuch a man's reſolutions of Amendment are but formal and of courſe; and that he is only over-awed with the
<pb n="99" facs="tcp:59207:58"/>greatneſs of the approaching Solemnity, and not truly out of love with his ſins which he pretends at this time a defiance to. The beſt evidence of the ſincerity of our Reſolutions is this that we do as we have reſolved: Unleſs we do this there can be nothing more inſignificant than our Reſolutions are. And ſure it is in every thing elſe we judge thus. Not he that re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolves but he that fights couragiouſly gets the victory. Our reſolving does not alone ſet forward any work, 'tis the putting our Reſolutions into practice which does avail us.</p>
               <p n="3">3. He that reſolves as he ought to do muſt reſolve not only upon the end but alſo upon the means which lead to it. We are forward to reſolve for Heaven at large, but conſider not of the way and means which will bring us thither. We are ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerally willing to be happy but yet we do readily excuſe our ſelves from the difficul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties and ſeverities of an holy life. He that reſolves to be <hi>temperate</hi> muſt alſo re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolve to avoid his <hi>evil Company</hi> that drew him to that exceſs, to paſs by the door where he is wont to be drawn in. He that reſolves to be chaſt muſt alſo reſolve to decline the houſe of a whoriſh Woman,
<pb n="100" facs="tcp:59207:59"/>and to ſet a watch upon himſelf that he be not enſnared with her enticements. He that reſolves againſt his ſin muſt reſolve al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſo againſt every thing which leads him to it; and he will ſhew himſelf ſincere in his Reſolutions by his uſe of ſuch means as would gain his end. There is nothing more ridiculous than our Reſolution if we reſolve upon the end, and not upon the means alſo which lead unto it. We think ſo in other things; we do not think we ſhall ever be rich by a reſolving only to be ſo. We muſt be provident and frugal as well as reſolute before we can attain our end. 'Tis not Reſolution makes a man learned unleſs he add endeavours to his Reſolution. We may reſolve what we will, but we ſhall be never the nearer to our end unleſs we uſe the means as well as reſolve upon the end. We never heard of any man that gained his end by reſolv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing upon it, unleſs he uſed means for the accompliſhing his intention. Reſolution does us no good when it is alone. It ſets us forward greatly when we uſe proper means, but unleſs we do that we are not at all advanced by it.</p>
               <p n="4">4. He that reſolves as he ſhould do places before his eyes the difficulties and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conveniences which he is like to meet with
<pb n="101" facs="tcp:59207:59"/>in his way. Like a wiſe builder he does forecaſt his charge before he begin his work; or like a prudent Commander he does well conſider his number, and ſtrength before he fall upon the army of his adverſaries, <hi>Luk.</hi> 14.28. He that reſolves to part with his ſin muſt reſolve to be for ever deaf to its allurements for the time to come, to ſubdue all his affecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons to it, to bid it an eternal farewell. And he may do well to think before-hand what difficulties and labours this will ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe him to. He will do well to think that he cannot do it unleſs he be always upon his watch, and denying the cravings of the ſenſual life. He muſt be content to croſs his own impetuous deſires, to diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pleaſe his companions and familiars, to be houted and laughed at as fool and co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward; He muſt reſolve to perſevere in an holy life although he diſpleaſe his great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt friends, although he loſe his worldly goods, aye and his life alſo. He that reſolves as he ſhould do, muſt ſet before his own eyes all the difficulties which he is to paſs through. Unleſs he do this it is not to be thought but he will be unprovided for his Chriſtian warfare. And he muſt do this after the moſt lively manner that can
<pb n="102" facs="tcp:59207:60"/>be, as if he were juſt ready to be put up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the trial. Let him conceive that he may preſently be put to it whether he will diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pleaſe God or forfeit his worldly eaſe and wealth: Whether he will ſuffer or ſin; whether he will chuſe to loſe his life or Gods favour. He ought not to look up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on theſe things at a great diſtance, but to ſuppoſe them near at hand and ready to be offered to him. This he muſt do if he will reſolve as he ought, and ſo as his pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſes may hold. We reſolve raſhly and at ventures, and that is the reaſon that our Reſolution comes to no good effect. We do as the Kinſman of <hi>Naomi</hi> did who when he was asked, <hi>Whether he would redeem the land of Elimelech?</hi> preſently ſays, <hi>I will redeem it;</hi> but then when he is told that he muſt alſo buy it of <hi>Ruth;</hi> he anſwers that he <hi>cannot redeem it,</hi> Ruth. 4. We do juſt ſo, we do readily reſolve for Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven very often, but yet when we ſee what it is like to coſt us we do as frequently revoke our word. The man in the Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpel would needs know of our Saviour what he ſhould do that he might <hi>have eternal Life:</hi> But when he underſtands what it will coſt him he <hi>goes away ſorrow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful,</hi> Matth. 19. We do very eaſily reſolve
<pb n="103" facs="tcp:59207:60"/>to be happy, but we are not willing to take pains to attain our deſires. We are very willing to have our hire but not wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling to bear the heat and burden of the day. He that reſolves to become a new man muſt arm himſelf with the whole ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mour of God: He muſt reſolve to be har<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy and couragious againſt all the ſhocks and encounters he is like to meet with in this preſent evil World. He may expect to meet with many troubles in his way, and therefore muſt reſolve very ſtedfaſtly not to alter his mind whatever rubs or ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtacles ſhall lie in his way.</p>
               <p n="5">5. He that reſolves as he ought to do doth earneſtly implore the grace and aſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance of Almighty God. He is very diſtruſtful of himſelf, and therefore does betake himſelf to the Divine aid and help. He knows that he ſtands in need of Gods aid, and that without him he can do no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing as he ought to do. He does not relie upon his own ſtrength and abilities, but then he thinks himſelf only ſafe when he flyes to God for help in the time of need. This is that upon which he does alone reſt and relie. He eaſily foreſees many ſtorms ariſing upon him, he can ea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſily diſcern that his ſtrength is ſmall, and
<pb n="104" facs="tcp:59207:61"/>that his enemies are ſubtle and ſtrong; and therefore he hath recourſe to him who is infinitely wiſe and ſtrong. He knows not how to fight againſt his ſubtle and his potent enemies, but yet he flyes to him that can teach his hands to war, and his fingers to fight. He promiſes nothing from himſelf but all things from God: He knows not how he ſhall bear a ſevere per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſecution, and a fiery trial, but yet he knows in whom he hath believed, and dares truſt him who is always able to ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>port him under the greateſt trouble, or deliver him from it. And therefore he does not greatly diſquiet himſelf how he ſhall be able to bear the ſorrows which he is like to meet with, but puts his ſole truſt in him who can do more than he is able to think. He well remembers that he goes forth in Gods ſtrength, and that God who does enable him to do his will, is able to give him ſtrength to ſuffer it alſo. And therefore his eye and his heart is always lifted up to Heaven, and he is full of hope becauſe the Lord is with him. He knows God will not fail him of his aid, and in this confidence it is that he reſolves. We are not like to ſucceed when we leave God out. We may project indeed but it is God
<pb n="105" facs="tcp:59207:61"/>who does diſpoſe and ſucceed our endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vours. We may reſolve what we will, but yet ſhall need the aid of Heaven to bring our purpoſes to effect. He that would bring his thoughts to paſs, muſt humbly implore the Grace of God; without him nothing is wiſe, nothing ſtrong. We therefore fall becauſe we truſt to our own ſtrength, we then do fooliſhly when we truſt to our own wiſdom; we then miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>carry when we want Gods grace and aſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance. He reſolves well that reſolves in the Lord, and that does humbly addreſs himſelf to him for ſtrength. For as with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out his leave we could never have been, ſo it is moſt certain that without his grace and help we are not able to think a good thought, much leſs are we able to do any which is good and acceptable in his ſight.</p>

               <p>BUt before we come to this Holy Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment we muſt alſo be endued with a true and a lively Faith. And we muſt exa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mine carefully whether or not our Faith be unfeigned and without hypocriſie. Which we have the greater reaſon to do, becauſe we ſhall find, even amongſt the profeſſors of Chriſtianity, a very falſe no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of Faith. For as it is ſometimes ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plained it is ſo far from making us better than we were before, and more fit to ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proach to God, that it does indeed either not at all advance us in a divine and holy life, or elſe obſtruct and retard us. And for our further help in this we may try our Faith by the following Rules.</p>
               <p n="1">1. It is not enough to denominate us Believers, that we do ſtrongly believe that our ſins are pardoned, and our perſons juſtified in the ſight of God. For as there may be a true Faith where there is not
<pb n="107" facs="tcp:59207:62"/>this belief, ſo there may be ſuch a ſtrong belief as this where there is no Faith that is ſaving. This belief, if it be well-ground<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed does preſuppoſe a true Faith, and therefore cannot be that Faith it ſelf. There are thoſe that are confident of Gods favour that are yet none of his friends. And if this belief of our good condition be not upon good grounds it is a fooliſh fancie, not an unfeigned Faith. We do very na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turally love our ſelves, and are very prone to think our ſelves the favourites of Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven when we are indeed the heirs of Hell. We eaſily grow big with an overweening opinion of our own good eſtate. But how well ſoever we believe of our ſelves, if we do not all this while make a right judgement, we have not a Faith of the right ſtamp.</p>
               <p n="2">2. We may not ſay we have a ſaving Faith, becauſe we do confidently expect the pardon of our ſins from our Lord Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſus Chriſt. It is not our bare caſting our ſelves upon Chriſt for pardon that will en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>title us to a true Faith. If all that were required of us were this, that we ſhould ſit ſtill, and without any more to do relie upon Chriſt for pardon and for life, for righteouſneſs and eternal glory, certainly
<pb n="108" facs="tcp:59207:63"/>would be no very hard thing to believe; and the world would not be ſo ſo full of unbelievers as now it is. Who would not be ſaved from the wrath to come! Who would not be glad to have his ſins forgiven him! Chriſt was never yet unwelcome to any man upon this ſcore. And if this were Faith, Chriſt may always find great ſtore of Faith upon Earth. The vileſt ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner who loves his folly is yet willing to have it pardoned, and that by Chriſt alſo. The Adulterer and the Drunkard love their ſin indeed but not the guilt and pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nalty. None are ſo fond of Hell but they will readily that Chriſt ſhould redeem them from it. Nor do they deſire to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>take themſelves to any other Saviour to redeem them from that horrour and thoſe pains. The blood of Jeſus they do rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dily fly to for Sanctuary againſt the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtroyer. However men are fond of their ſin, yet ſure no man is fond of the ſting and plague which it leaves behind it. Such a recumbency and relying upon Chriſt as this is not enough to ſhew that we have ſaving Faith. We ſhall infinitely deceive our ſelves if we have no other Faith but this. The way to Heaven were very ea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſie if ſuch a Faith as this would bring us
<pb n="109" facs="tcp:59207:63"/>thither. Our ſins would be no obſtacle to us if this were all that were required. Our greateſt ſins and ſuch a Faith as this might eaſily conſiſt with each other. We ſhall not need much labour to perſwade men to believe if this were all that is meant by it. We are very willing to be ſaved at ſo cheap a rate. We are ready enough to receive the pardon which the Goſpel brings us the tydings of. We are content that Jeſus ſhould ſave us from our ſins, that is, from the puniſhment and guilt of them. And we are very forward to believe this was the main, if not the only end of his coming into the World.</p>
               <p n="3">3. Nor will the bare aſſent to the hiſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry of the Goſpel be enough to entitle us to a ſaving Faith. We may believe the truth of what we there find and yet be very far from the Kingdom of God. Indeed unleſs we do this we cannot have a ſaving Faith; but it is not our bare believing all this which is a ſufficient argument of ſuch a Faith. For ſaving Faith is that which im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plys more than the aſſent of the mind to the truth of that which is revealed and made known. For we are not juſtified by this aſſent of our underſtanding. There are great arguments to evict the truth of Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtianity;
<pb n="110" facs="tcp:59207:64"/>ſo great and ſo powerful that if we apprehend them aright, we cannot but aſſent to the truth of what they do infer, and it is not in our power to reſiſt ſo great an evidence. For we cannot be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve what we pleaſe, but muſt needs aſſent to what is evident to our underſtanding. And to do this is ſo far from being a ſav<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Faith that it may belong to thoſe who are not in a ſtate of Salvation. There have been many that have believed the Hiſtory of the Goſpel, and made profeſſion of this belief alſo, who yet have turn'd Apoſtates. It is very poſſible that a man's reaſon may be ſatisfied in the truth of Chriſtianity, and yet ſtill he may remain in a very dange<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous eſtate as to his own Salvation; we find that <hi>many believed in the name of Chriſt, when they ſaw the miracles which he did.</hi> That is, they were convinced by the works which Jeſus did, that he came from God, and conſequently muſt needs be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve what he ſaid to be true. But this Faith in the name of Jeſus does not ſeem to be ſuch as our Saviour thought ſuffici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent; for it is preſently added, <hi>That Jeſus did not commit himſelf unto them, becauſe he knew all men,</hi> Joh. 2.23, 24. Our Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viour would not truſt them who yet be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieved
<pb n="111" facs="tcp:59207:64"/>on his name, when they ſaw the Miracles which he did. And we read of others who are ſaid <hi>to believe on him;</hi> who for all that are called by our Saviour <hi>the Children of the Devil,</hi> Joh. 8.30, 31, 44. We may ſee great reaſon to believe the truth of the Goſpel (the belief of which we cannot reſiſt) and yet not be en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dued with a Faith that is ſaving, if we go no farther.</p>
               <p>Indeed the Scripture ſometimes ſpeaks as if the aſſent to the articles of Chriſtiani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty were ſufficient to our Salvation: <hi>If thou ſhalt confeſs with thy mouth the Lord Jeſus, and ſhalt believe in thine heart that God hath raiſed him from the dead, thou ſhalt be ſaved. For with the heart man believeth unto righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſneſs, and with the mouth confeſſion is made unto Salvation,</hi> Rom. 10.9, 10. Again, <hi>Whoſoever believeth that Jeſus is the Christ, is born of God,</hi> 1 Joh. 5.1. And again, <hi>Hereby know ye the Spirit of God, every ſpirit that confeſſeth that Jeſus Christ is come in the fleſh, is of God,</hi> Chap. 4. <hi>ver.</hi> 2. Again, <hi>No man can ſay that Jeſus is the Lord but by the Holy Ghoſt,</hi> 1 Cor. 12.3. Which expreſſions ſeem to intimate that there is no more required to make our Faith ſaving but this that we do hearti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
<pb n="112" facs="tcp:59207:65"/>believe, and alſo profeſs the articles of the Chriſtian Religion.</p>
               <p>But certain it is (however we miſun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtand our ſelves, and miſtake the mean<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of theſe places) ſuch a Faith as this (though it be enough to leave us without excuſe) will not ſave our Souls.</p>
               <p>And therefore as to the words of Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture which are brought to this purpoſe, there are theſe two things to be conſide<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red.</p>
               <p>Firſt, the time in which theſe words were ſpoken, and that was in the early dayes of Chriſtianity, when there was dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger in profeſſing the Religion of Chriſt. In the beginning of Chriſtian Religion, he that made a profeſſion of it expoſed him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf to the fury of Jew and Gentile. The <hi>Jews</hi> had <hi>agreed</hi> (while Jeſus was alive) <hi>that if any man did confeſs that he was Christ he ſhould be put out of the Synagogue.</hi> And the man that was reſtored to his ſight we find <hi>cast out</hi> by the <hi>Jews</hi> for pleading that Jeſus muſt needs be from God, <hi>Joh.</hi> 9.22, 34. And we read afterwards how very furiouſly the <hi>Jews</hi> did perſecute them who did profeſs the Faith of Chriſt. And they who did profeſs Chriſt among the Gentiles, were not only derided for the
<pb n="113" facs="tcp:59207:65"/>ſake of their crucified Saviour, but alſo perſecuted for his names ſake. And when they were ſo it was no eaſie thing to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſs Chriſtianity. Indeed as things are now we do very eaſily profeſs our Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion; 'Tis that which agrees well with the Laws of the Country, and the cuſtom of the place we live in. It puts us now to no expence to profeſs Jeſus to be the Chriſt. We can do it without the fear of the <hi>Jew,</hi> or any other. There is no man ſuffers among us becauſe he is a Chriſtian. We may profeſs that Jeſus is riſen from the dead, and that he is the Chriſt with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out any moleſtation. And therefore this profeſſion is no argument now that we have a ſaving Faith. But were it now with us as it was with the firſt Chriſtians, it would be indeed an argument of our ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerity. If it would coſt us our lives or eſtates to confeſs the Faith of Chriſt, then we might hope well of our ſelves if we re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained our confidence unto the end. This would argue us to be the faithful and ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nuine followers of our Lord. It is an eaſie thing to profeſs the Faith when we loſe nothing by this profeſſion: But we can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not be his Diſciples till we do prefer him before our Houſes and Lands, and our Life
<pb n="114" facs="tcp:59207:66"/>it ſelf. This was that which the firſt Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tyrs or Witneſſes of the Reſurrection did. They durſt own Jeſus to be the Chriſt though they paid their blood, and ſacri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficed their lives for him. No terrors, or torments could make them deny the Lord that bought them. The Faith of the Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpel was dearer to them than all the beſt things of this preſent life. They that did this were indeed born of God. And their pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tient ſufferings for Chriſt were an evident argument of the ſincerity of their Faith.</p>
               <p>Secondly, it is very certain (and this follows from what was ſaid before) that the <hi>confeſſing</hi> of <hi>Chriſt,</hi> the <hi>ſaying</hi> that he is the <hi>Lord,</hi> the <hi>believing that Jeſus</hi> is the <hi>Chriſt,</hi> and <hi>confeſſing that he is come in the fleſh,</hi> do imply a life agreeable to ſuch a profeſſion, 1 <hi>John</hi> 5: 4, 5. If the be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lief of theſe things have an influence upon our lives, if it regulate and form them to a due and proportionable obedience, then indeed we are born of God and ſhall be ſaved. If we believe that Chriſt is riſen, and do (which ſuch a belief ſhould teach us to do) alſo riſe with him to newneſs of life: If we believe Jeſus to be the Chriſt, and accordingly ſubmit to him in all his offices; if we call him Lord, and then do
<pb n="115" facs="tcp:59207:66"/>whatſoever he commands; then indeed we are Gods Children, and ſhall be ſav<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed. It is very evident that no leſs than this can be meant by thoſe expreſſions, which are before named; we cannot ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gine that it is enough to call him Lord though we obey him not. To believe that he roſe from the dead when we lie in the grave of our ſin and filthineſs. Certainly theſe expreſſions import the belief and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſion of theſe truths, and a life anſwer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able to ſuch a belief. Were it not ſo it would be a moſt eaſie thing to be a Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtian, and our Faith were very reconcilea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble with our evil lives. And therefore I add,</p>
               <p n="4">4. A true and ſaving Faith is productive of a good life. We muſt not only believe that what God hath revealed is true, but we muſt conſent to it, and yield our ſelves obedient. The Goſpel may be looked upon either as an Hiſtory of things that were done and ſaid; or as a tendry and offer of mercy upon terms and conditions which are therein ſpecified and propound<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed. And accordingly he that believes to Salvation does not only aſſent to what is therein revealed and made known, but alſo conſent to embrace the mercy that is
<pb n="116" facs="tcp:59207:67"/>there offered upon thoſe terms upon which it is propounded. For a man may believe what is revealed to be true and to have come from God, and yet refuſe to give up himſelf to the obedience of thoſe precepts and rules which are there injoyned him in order to his eternal Salvation. The holy Scriptures require of us ſuch a belief as is accompanied with obedience. And when it commands us the belief of the Goſpel, it requires that we ſhould ſhew by our actions that we do believe it. That is, that we ſhould ſo behave our ſelves as we do in other things which we do believe, and how we do in other things it is eaſie to obſerve. If men do upon rational grounds believe that they may attain their ends, be it riches or honour, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> by uſing ſuch or ſuch a method and courſe, they do dili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gently ſet themſelves to work that they may accompliſh their deſigns. Nay a ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry ſmall aſſurance will ſet men to work in theſe caſes. The Merchant out of the un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>certain hope of wealth will venture him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf, and what he hath, upon a rough and a doubtful Sea. The Ambitious man of Wars, for the hope of a victory and a tri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>umph, will adventure his life upon the chance of battel. The Husbandman
<pb n="117" facs="tcp:59207:67"/>that believes he ſhall fill his Barns and Cof<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fers by his labour, and pains, will riſe up early, and ſit up late, and eat the bread of carefulneſs. He will ſpare nor coſt nor pains; he will not be diſmayed with the burden of the Summers heat, nor the keen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of the Winters cold; he will do and he will ſuffer, no pains or care are thought too much that he may obtain his end. Men do this when they have no aſſurance of ſucceſs, and when the thing which they aim at is not worth their while. Yet theſe pains they take becauſe they beleive their ſucceſs is poſſible, and that their labour may not be loſt. If men did believe the Goſpel at this rate what would they not do that they might lay hold of eternal life? Here's a ſure word of promiſe, and here's a great promiſe too; here's all the encourage<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment that can be imagined; here's eternal life before us, that unſpeakable gift; and the greateſt aſſurance of it upon the terms offered; God himſelf who cannot lie or repent, hath promiſed; if we did believe this as much as we do other things (w<hi rend="sup">ch</hi> we have not ſuch reaſon to believe) we ſhould not be idle and lazy, but we ſhould give all diligence, we ſhould always abound in the work of the Lord, knowing that
<pb n="118" facs="tcp:59207:68"/>our labour would not be in vain in the Lord. Certainly thus it would be with us if our Faith were as it ſhould be, if it were genuine and of the right ſtamp. But if we ſit ſtill and be unconcerned in the great affair of our Souls; if we be lazy, and without devotion, we may indeed boaſt of a Faith, but it is a dead Faith; and we may pleaſe our ſelves with a good opinion of our eſtate, but ſure it is we are not riſen with Chriſt, but we are dead in our treſpaſſes and ſins.</p>
               <p>Then we do indeed ſavingly believe the Goſpel when this belief of it begets in us a good life. Unleſs it have this effect upon us we are infidels and unbelievers. For we cannot think our ſelves better then the Heathens for our Faith, if our works be not better than theirs. If we know theſe things and do not do them we are worſe than they who know them not. He be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieves as he ſhould do that lives as he does believe. The Goſpel tells us that <hi>without holineſs no man ſhall ſee God,</hi> Heb. 12.14. Who can imagine that the man believes this, who does confidently expect to go to Heaven, and yet takes no care to p<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="2 letters">
                     <desc>••</desc>
                  </gap>ge and cleanſe his heart. He that be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieves
<pb n="119" facs="tcp:59207:68"/>it as he ought endeavours to be ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly as God is holy. Again, the Goſpel tells us that we muſt <hi>not ſwear at all,</hi> Matth. 5.34. Nay more than that, that we ſhall <hi>give an account at the day of judgement for every idle word we ſpeak,</hi> Matth. 12.36. Now certain it is that there are many who ſwear in their ordinary converſation, and others alſo who forſwear themſelves, and whoſe mouths are full of curſing and bitterneſs. And who can think that ſuch men as theſe are, do believe the Goſpel as they ſhould do? He believes aright who does practiſe thoſe precepts which he pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſes the belief of. He that does not that is an unbeliever. He may <hi>profeſs that he knows God but in works he denies him,</hi> Tit. 1.16. and they that do ſo the Apoſtle reckons among the <hi>unbelieving,</hi> ver. 15. Our Saviour tells us that <hi>he that believeth on the Son, hath everlaſting life,</hi> i. e. he that obeyeth the Son;<note place="margin">

And when the Apoſtle tells us that God ſware to ſome that they ſhould not enter into his reſt, he adds that it was to them <hi>who believ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
<pb n="120" facs="tcp:59207:69"/>not;</hi> ſo we render the words, but they might be rendred, <hi>to them who obeyed not.</hi>

                     </gap>.</note> And then he preſent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly infers, <hi>we ſee that they could not enter in becauſe of unbelief,</hi> Heb. 3.18, 19.</p>
               <p>To believe on the name of Chriſt is to receive him, <hi>Joh.</hi> 1.12. But if we re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive him, as we ſhould, we muſt receive him and acknowledge him in all his Of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fices, as our Prophet, Prieſt and King. That is, we muſt believe the truth of his Doctrine as he is our great Prophet, and that Teacher who came from God; and then we muſt obey his Precepts as he is our Lord and our King; as well as expect pardon from him as he is our Prieſt; and our Atonement. We muſt receive him as he is offered to us in the Goſpel, and not only confidently expect our pardon from him; but we muſt receive him as God hath ſent him, and <hi>God hath ſent him to bleſs you in turning away every one of you from his iniquities,</hi> Act. 3.26. Now that it is ſuch a Faith in Chriſt, as I have been ſpeaking of, which the Scriptures require of us in order to our eternal Salvation, will appear.</p>
               <p n="1">1. If we conſider the great end of the
<pb n="121" facs="tcp:59207:69"/>manifeſtation of Jeſus Chriſt, or the great purpoſe for which he was ſent into the World. Now we muſt not think that Chriſt came into the world, and did and ſuffered thoſe great things which we read of him, only to procure our pardon and indemnity; we muſt not think that the only end of all this was that we might be delivered from the evil effects and bad con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſequents of our ſins; he would be cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainly a welcome Saviour to the worſt of mankind upon this ſcore. For provided <hi>we may enjoy our ſins,</hi> we are content that he ſhould <hi>ſuffer for them.</hi> We are very willing that he ſhould <hi>bear</hi> the <hi>blame,</hi> pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vided we may but have the liberty to <hi>commit</hi> the <hi>fault.</hi> Though we love our ſins well yet are we not fond of the ſor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rows which they bring with them. We are willing enough that Chriſt ſhould pay our ſcores; and well pleaſed to live in our ſins, and take it kindly that Chriſt would die for them. But certain it is that Chriſt appeared and ſuffered for us too that he might deliver us from the power and do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minion as well as from the guilt of our ſins. He did not die for ſin that we might live in it. He never came to diſcharge us from our duty; we think unworthily of
<pb n="122" facs="tcp:59207:70"/>our Saviour, and of our Religion if we think thus. He came to plant the divine life in our hearts, to make us better and more like unto God. Let the holy Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures ſpeak in this matter. His name is called <hi>Jeſus,</hi> becauſe he <hi>ſhould ſave his peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple from their ſins,</hi> Matth. 1.21. It is ridi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culous to ſay that by ſins is meant no more than the puniſhment of them. Nor can we think that Chriſt came into the world for no other end. He would then have taken away the effect and left the cauſe remaining: This would be to remove the leſs evil and to let the greater continue; as if a Phyſician ſhould only project how to remove or abate the ſymptom, and take no care to ſuppreſs the diſeaſe, and remove the morbifick matter which is the cauſe of it. Certainly we think meanly of our Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viours deſign if we think this was all his buſineſs in the World. He came to ſave us from our ſins, and they are a greater evil ſure than the effects of them. This is a nobler conqueſt than to deliver us from death. And this ſure was the great pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe of our bleſſed Saviour. When God promiſed the <hi>Meſſias,</hi> no leſs bleſſing was contained in that promiſe than this, <hi>that we might ſerve him without fear in holineſs
<pb n="123" facs="tcp:59207:70"/>and righteouſneſs before him all the days of our Life,</hi> Luk. 1.74, 75. The Apoſtle cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainly underſtood the great end for which Chriſt appeared: He tells us that <hi>for this purpoſe the Son of God was manifeſted that he might deſtroy the works of the Devil,</hi> 1 Joh. 3.8. And that this was one great end why our Lord laid down his life, no man can deny that gives any credit to the Holy Scriptures. There we are told that <hi>he gave himſelf for us, that he might redeem us from all iniquity, and purifie unto himſelf a peculiar people zealous of good works,</hi> Tit. 2.14. Again it is ſaid that, <hi>he gave himſelf, for our ſins, that he might deliver us from this preſent evil World,</hi> Gal. 1.4. And, <hi>that he dyed for all, that they which live ſhould not henceforth live unto themſelves, but unto him which dyed for them, and roſe again,</hi> 2 Cor. 5.15. He dyed for his Church indeed, but then <hi>he gave himſelf for it; that he might ſanctifie and cleanſe it with the waſhing of water, by the word, that he might preſent it to himſelf a glorious Church, not having ſpot or wrinkle, or any ſuch thing, but that it ſhould be Holy, and without blem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iſh,</hi> Eph. 5.25, 26, 27. The ſame Apoſtle tells his <hi>Coloſſians</hi> that Chriſt hath reconci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led them, <hi>in the body of his fleſh through
<pb n="124" facs="tcp:59207:71"/>death, to preſent them holy and unblamable, and unreprovable in his ſight,</hi> Col. 1.21, 22. Beſides what hath been ſaid, we are from the death of Chriſt exhorted to an Holy Life, 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 4.1, 2. <hi>Rom.</hi> 6.3, 4. 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 5.7, 8. Which certainly we could not ſo effectually have been, had our Saviour on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly dyed for our Indemnity, and to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cure our pardon. But ſince he dyed for ſin, that we might not live in it, well may we from his death be exhorted to an Holy Life and Converſation. Which if we do not lead, we do then fruſtrate and make void the great end and purpoſe for which our Lord was ſent into the world. Now this makes it evident, that where there is a ſaving Faith in Chriſt it is ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>companied with an Holy Life: And that we do but pretend to be Believers of the Goſpel, if we do not obey its Precepts, and perform thoſe Conditions which it doth require at our hands. For we then do believe the Goſpel, when we believe all the parts of it. Now certain it is that the Goſpel does not only bring us the ty<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dings of pardon, but it makes known the conditions upon which this Grace and Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour is offered. And it will avail us no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing that we accept the pardon, if we do
<pb n="125" facs="tcp:59207:71"/>refuſe the condition upon which it is offer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed unto us; for this is but to believe the Goſpel in part, and to be but almoſt Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtians. The Goſpel does not only contain an Hiſtory of what was ſaid and done, and ſuffered by our Lord; but alſo pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſes, precepts, and threats; and he does fully believe this Goſpel, who not only be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieves the truth of what is there related, but obeys its Precepts, ſubmits to the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition of its promiſes, and reveres its threats. We do eaſily believe that Chriſt dyed for our ſins, but this is but part of what the Goſpel tells us: We muſt alſo believe that therefore we are not to live in them: And that he did not only dye to redeem us from wrath but from our vain Converſations alſo. We believe that Chriſt is our Atonement: 'Tis well, but then we muſt believe that he is our Law-giver, and our Lord; and muſt own him for our King, as well as for our Prieſt. And if we believe that he dyed for this end, that he might be our propitiation, and our ran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſom, we muſt alſo believe that <hi>to this end Chriſt both dyed, and roſe, and revived, that he might be Lord both of the dead and living,</hi> Rom. 14.9. And certainly if we think it an act of Faith to acknowledge him for
<pb n="126" facs="tcp:59207:72"/>our Prieſt, and conſequently to reſt upon him for our Salvation; we muſt needs think it an act of Faith to acknowledge him for our King and Lord, and conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently to obey his commands. And un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs we do obey him we do but mock him when we call him Lord: <hi>Why call ye me Lord, Lord, and do not the things which <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 word">

                     </gap> ſay?</hi> Luk. 6.46. If Chriſt be our Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deemer he is our Lord too; and if he came to procure our pardon, he alſo came to amend our hearts and lives for the time to come. And methinks the words of St. <hi>Peter</hi> are very plain, and yet very Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phatical alſo to the purpoſe in hand: He tells the <hi>Jews</hi> that God had <hi>exalted Jeſus with his right hand,</hi> and for what end he had exalted him, he adds in the next words, to be a <hi>Prince and a Saviour, for to give Repentance to Iſrael, and forgiveneſs of ſins,</hi> Act. 5.31. So that if we believe him to be our <hi>Saviour,</hi> yet we muſt be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve him to be our <hi>Prince,</hi> and when we hope for <hi>forgiveneſs</hi> of <hi>ſins,</hi> we muſt be firſt endued with <hi>repentance</hi> in order to it. Our Saviour he is, but then he is our Lord firſt. He is the <hi>Author of Eternal Salvati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on;</hi> but to whom is he ſo? <hi>it is to them that obey him,</hi> Heb. 5.9. He came to ſave
<pb n="127" facs="tcp:59207:72"/>ſinners; 'tis true, but he came to ſave them from their ſins. They muſt be divorced from their ſins, or elſe may not expect to be ſaved. He was not obedient that we might have leave to rebel; he did not ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer for ſin, that we might live in it without controul. He did not do his Fathers will that we might do our own. He did not come only to diſpoſſeſs the Devil out of Temples and Oracles, or the bodies of men, but to drive him alſo out of mens hearts and lives. He came to ſet us at li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berty from our ſins, and from the evil ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fects of them. And we may not think we have gained the end of our Saviours be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing manifeſted, till we are ſet free from the ſlavery of our ſins. And that Faith which lets us ſpare our ſins, and ſuffers us to live in a contradiction to the commands of Chriſt, will never ſave our Souls.</p>
               <p n="2">2. This will farther appear to be a great Truth, that a true and ſaving Faith is productive of a good life, and that the Goſpel does not require a leſs Faith than this, if we do conſider the <hi>Faith of Abra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ham,</hi> who is the Father of the faithful: His Faith is much ſpoken of in the New Teſtament, and ſeems to be ſet there as the pattern of our Faith. And therefore
<pb n="128" facs="tcp:59207:73"/>it will be worth our while to conſider what kind of Faith that is, which the Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly Scriptures take ſo great notice of <hi>Abra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ham</hi> for. Now there are two things very remarkable in this Faith of <hi>Abraham.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="1">1. That he did believe that God would make good his promiſe which he had made to him. And this he did firmly believe notwithſtanding the great unlikelihood of the thing promiſed, had he conſulted with fleſh and blood. He had a great aſſurance that God would make his word good unto him, though it ſeemed to contradict the ordinary courſe of nature, and the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon reaſonings of Mankind. He knew not how the thing could come to paſs, but yet he judged him faithful and able to do it, who had made the promiſe to him. <hi>'Being not weak in faith he conſidered not his own body now dead, when hs was about an hundred years old, neither yet the deadneſs of Sarahs Womb: He ſtaggered not at the promiſe of God through unbelief; but was ſtrong in faith, giving glory to God; and being fully perſwaded that what he had pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſed, he was able alſo to perform,</hi> Rom. 4.19, 20, 11. Thus did <hi>Abraham against hope, believe in hope,</hi> v. 18. He could have no natural hopes that this promiſe ſhould
<pb n="129" facs="tcp:59207:73"/>be verified, but yet he believed it would becauſe God had made the promiſe; up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on this it is that he reſts and ſtays himſelf. He does not diſpute either Gods Veracity or Power. Now then our Faith is like that of <hi>Abraham,</hi> when we do believe, what God hath revealed and promiſed, though the thing revealed ſhould in it ſelf ſeem very myſterious and ſtrange to our reaſon, and the thing promiſed very un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>likely in it ſelf to come to paſs. We ought to believe that which God ſayes; for his revealing of it makes it <hi>evidently credible,</hi> though the thing it ſelf be not in it ſelf <hi>evidently true.</hi> We have ſufficient reaſon to believe, when yet this reaſon does not ſtand upon the evidence of the thing, but upon the veracity of him who makes it known to us. Then we do believe as <hi>Abraham</hi> did, when we acquieſce in Gods Veracity and Power. He that hath a true Faith does believe what God hath reveal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, and doubts not but God will make his promiſe good. He does intirely truſt in God in whom he hath believed: And he will neither reject an Article of Faith, becauſe his reaſon cannot comprehend it, nor yet will he diſtruſt Gods All-ſufficien<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy and Veracity when he is in ſtraits and
<pb n="130" facs="tcp:59207:74"/>difficulties. He that believes as he ſhould when trouble comes, is not diſmaid, for his heart is fixed truſting in the Lord. He well knows that God is faithful, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore he quiets himſelf when the greateſt ſtorms ariſe.</p>
               <p n="2">2. <hi>Abraham</hi> did yield himſelf obedient to Gods commands alſo, how croſs ſoever they were to fleſh and blood. And his doing that was an act of that Faith, which he is celebrated for in the Holy Scriptures. When God commands him to leave his Country, his kindred and his Fathers houſe, <hi>Gen.</hi> 12.1. He readily departs, <hi>ver.</hi> 4. And obeys God who had commanded him though the thing it ſelf were ſo very dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficult. For 'tis no eaſie thing at ſuch an age to leave ones Country, our kindred and fathers houſe, and go to a land which we know not of. But this <hi>Abraham</hi> did, and it was an act of his Faith alſo. <hi>By faith</hi> Abraham, <hi>when he was called to go out into a place which he ſhould after receive for an inheritance, obeyed; and he went out not knowing whither he went,</hi> Heb. 11.8. Again, when God had given him a Son, a Son of all his hopes, and of his old age, a Son whom he loved, and his only Son too, a Son of the promiſe, and of the free Wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man:
<pb n="131" facs="tcp:59207:74"/>yet when God who gave him re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quires him of him, he is not only willing to part with him, but with his own hands to ſacrifice him where God appoints him, <hi>Gen.</hi> 22. And this was an act of his Faith alſo, for ſo we read: <hi>By faith</hi> Abraham <hi>when he was tried, offered up Iſaac; and he that received the promiſes, offered up his only begotten Son; of whom it was ſaid, that in</hi> Iſaac <hi>ſhall thy ſeed be called,</hi> Heb. 11.17, 18. Such a Faith had this Father of the Faith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful; and ſuch a Faith as this muſt we have alſo if we would be the Children of <hi>Abra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ham.</hi> He hath the Faith of <hi>Abraham,</hi> and he only that doth his works. If our Faith be ſaving we ſhall yield our ſelves obedient to all the Laws of God. Nothing will be ſo dear to us as the words of Gods mouth: We ſhall part with every thing quietly which God commands away from us. We ſhall obey his Precepts as well as believe his promiſes, if our Faith be of the right ſtamp. We ſhall be at Gods diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe if we be ſuch Believers as we ought to be. And our great care will be this that we reſign up our will to the will of God. We do but pretend to Faith if we be void of good works. And then we may only be thought to be the Children of <hi>Abraham</hi>
                  <pb n="132" facs="tcp:59207:75"/>when we do his works. <hi>Abraham</hi> ſhewed his faith by his works, and ſo muſt we do alſo. <hi>For as the body without the ſpirit is dead, ſo faith without works is dead alſo,</hi> Jam. 2.26.</p>
               <p n="3">3. It will farther appear that a ſaving Faith is productive of a good life if we do but diligently conſider what great things the Holy Scriptures ſpeak of Faith. For it is greatly magnified in the holy writ, and ſuch things are ſaid of it as do greatly advance it above that lazy and ineffectual faith which we pleaſe our ſelves with. Ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry many and very excellent things are ſaid to have been done by Faith, <hi>Heb.</hi> 11. This made the Sacrifice of <hi>Abel</hi> more ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellent in Gods ſight than that of <hi>Cain.</hi> 'Twas by Faith that <hi>Enoch</hi> pleaſed God, and was tranſlated: This puts <hi>Noah</hi> upon making the Ark in which a remnant of of the World were ſaved. By Faith <hi>Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes</hi> contemns the riches and pleaſures of the <hi>Egyptian</hi> Court, and rather chuſes to ſuffer affliction with Gods people. This carried the <hi>Iſraclites</hi> through the Red Sea, this threw down the Walls of <hi>Jericho</hi> and ſav<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed <hi>Rahab</hi> from that common deſtruction. Faith ſubdued Kingdoms, wrought Righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teouſneſs, obtained Promiſes, ſtopped the
<pb n="133" facs="tcp:59207:75"/>mouths of Lions, overcame fire and ſword, made weakneſs ſtrong, turned armies to flight. This put courage and reſolution into the weak, and prevailed againſt that which did oppoſe it. Great are the works which a true and ſaving Faith hath done.</p>
               <p>It enables both to do and ſuffer for the name of Chriſt. It enables us to perform the hardeſt tasks of Religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on: It will enable us to forgive our of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fending brother, <hi>Luk.</hi> 17.5. And to cleanſe our hearts of our filthineſ, <hi>Act.</hi> 15.9. Aye, and beſide all this the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtle tells us, that <hi>this is the vistory that overcometh the World even our faith,</hi> 1 Joh. 5.4. And when the Apoſtle exhorts us to put on the whole armour of God, he bids us, <hi>above all</hi> to take <hi>the ſheild of faith, wherewith we ſhall be able to quench all the fiery darts of the wicked,</hi> Epheſ. 6.16. So that it is the great engine againſt the De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vil, the World, and the Fleſh. It van<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quiſhes our Spiritual enemies, and tri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>umphs over them. It works miraculouſly where it is. It ſubdues our luſts, and en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ables us to conquer our greateſt enemies. And certainly then, the Faith which the Scriptures ſpeak thus greatly of is not a
<pb n="134" facs="tcp:59207:76"/>ſluggiſh and lazy Faith, but it does pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duce in us a great change of Heart and Life.</p>
               <p>Our Saviour tells his Diſciples that if they had <hi>faith as a grain of muſtard-ſeed,</hi> they might ſay to a <hi>mountain remove hence to yonder place, and it ſhall remove, and nothing ſhould be impoſſible unto them,</hi> Mat. 17.20. It is true indeed the firſt Prea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chers of the Goſpel had the power of do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Miracles beſtowed upon them; ſuch a faith had they but we have it not: But yet we have a Faith ſtill, if we be the genuine followers of Chriſt, that does enable us to do works that are miraculous alſo, though not in the ſame kind with theirs. Indeed they had power to do great Miracles and wonderful works in the World for the confirming that Goſpel which was but newly planted among men. This power is now ceaſed with the reaſon of it.<note place="margin">vid. <hi>Chryſoſt. vol.</hi> 5. <hi>p.</hi> 274. <hi>Edit.</hi> Savil.</note> But yet a true Faith does very mighty works, and ſuch as are as pleaſing to God, and of themſelves more advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tagious to us than that power of working Miracles would have been. They caſt out Devils, and could eaſily diſpoſſeſs them from the <hi>bodies</hi> of men; but then
<pb n="135" facs="tcp:59207:76"/>our Faith enables us to <hi>caſt</hi> him out of our <hi>hearts;</hi> They cured <hi>diſeaſes</hi> that were <hi>bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dily,</hi> our Faith <hi>cleanſes</hi> our <hi>Souls.</hi> They could <hi>raiſe</hi> the <hi>dead,</hi> our Faith raiſes us from the <hi>death</hi> of <hi>ſin</hi> to the life of Righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſneſs. They could heal Lepers, give ſight to the Blind, reſtore the Lame, and deſtroy the obſtinate offenders. Our ſav<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Faith cures our leproſie of Sin, opens our blind eyes, enables us to walk in Gods ways, and throws down the obſtacles that lie in our way. What was done by the firſt Preachers of the Goſpel is done daily by every ſincere Chriſtian. If they de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtroyed the Devil, ſo does he. They turn'd him out of his Temples, he out of his heart. The works of Faith now are as momentous as that of Miracles: He that overcomes the world, and vanquiſhes his luſts, he that deſpiſes riches and conquers himſelf, does works as pleaſing to God, and as profitable to himſelf, as he that removed Mountains and caſt them into the Sea. Nay ſuch works as theſe are better for us; and more acceptable to God than the power of doing the greateſt Miracles. He that lives well does more than he that wrought Miracles. It was not the power of doing Wonders that made men Chriſtians. Their
<pb n="136" facs="tcp:59207:77"/>Chriſtianity did conſiſt in the obedience of there lives. He that obeys the Goſpel (and our Faith teacheth us to do ſo) receives the grace &amp; mercy w<hi rend="sup">ch</hi> it offers. If we could do wonders and yet remained void of the love and image of God we would not be in the ſtate of Salvation. The lives of the Apoſtles made them dear to God, and not their miracles. And St. <hi>Luke</hi> when he writes the ſtory of what the Apoſtles did, does not give his Book the title of the <hi>Miracles of the Apoſtles,</hi> but the <hi>Acts</hi> or <hi>Practices</hi> of the Apoſtles is the title which it bears. Our Saviour bids the Diſciples <hi>not to rejoyce that the ſpirits are ſubject to them; but rather,</hi> ſays he, <hi>rejoyce becauſe your names are written in Heaven, Luk.</hi> 10.20. Our obedience does intitle us to Gods favour, but ſo does not our power to do wonderful works. If we work ini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quity it is not the gift of working Mira<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cles that ſhall ſtand us in ſtead. <hi>Many,</hi> ſays Chriſt, <hi>will ſay to me in that day, Lord, Lord, have not we propheſied in thy name? And in thy name have cast out Devils? And in thy name done many wonderful works? And then will I profeſs unto them, I never knew you, depart from me ye that work ini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quity,</hi> Matth. 7.22, 23. That Faith
<pb n="137" facs="tcp:59207:77"/>which wrought Miracles endured but for a time, but the Faith which works righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſneſs is to abide for ever. If our Faith cleanſe and purifie our hearts we ſhall not need be troubled that it does not remove Mountains. If we be condemned at that great day, it ſhall not be becauſe we did not work Miracles, but becauſe we did not feed the hungred, and cloth the nak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, &amp;c. <hi>Matth.</hi> 25. <hi>Jam.</hi> 2.15, 16. 'Tis our ſincere obedience to the Goſpel which God requires and will reward here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>after. We muſt ſhew our Faith by our works as <hi>Abraham</hi> did, or elſe we ſhall have no reaſon to judge Faith ſaving. If it be ſuch a Faith as cleanſeth our hearts, if it enable us to forgive our enemies, if it help us to overcome the World; if it make us ſtrong againſt Temptations, pati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent under Afflictions, conſtant under Tri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>als, and careful to obey God, then it is ſuch a Faith as God requires of us. But if on the other hand it be but a lazy be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lief of the truth of the Goſpel, and a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fident expectation however of grace and pardon, it is not ſuch a Faith that will ſave our Souls: And let us never ſo much vaunt our ſelves that we magnifie the free Grace of God, when we profeſs a recumbency
<pb n="138" facs="tcp:59207:78"/>upon Chriſt, and a reſting upon him for Salvation; yet if we remain idle and diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>obedient this Faith will not avail us. He does ſavingly believe that does aſſent to the truth of what God hath revealed, and is ſo far in love with it alſo that he does ſincerely and heartily give himſelf up to the obedience of it. And he that does this as he ought, is ſo far from depreſſing the freeneſs of Gods Grace, and exalting him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf, that when he hath done all that he can, and which is commanded, he can ſay from the bottom of his heart that he is an unprofitable Servant, and hath done that which was his duty to do, <hi>Luk.</hi> 17.10.</p>

               <p>BUT as we muſt examine our <hi>Faith</hi> to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards <hi>God,</hi> ſo we muſt try our <hi>love</hi> towards <hi>one another.</hi> For the Euchariſt is a <hi>feast</hi> of <hi>love,</hi> and a <hi>Sacrament</hi> of <hi>Charity.</hi> And was not only deſigned for our renew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing our moſt ſolemn Covenant with God, but alſo for the maintaining a fervent Cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity with one another, as hath been ſhew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed before. Now as we are too forward to profeſs a Faith which we have not, ſo it is to be feared, we do commonly pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſs a Charity when we are devoid of it. And therefore it will very highly concern us to enquire diligently, whether or no we have a fervent Charity and Love to one another. For the Holy Scriptures commend to us a <hi>Love without diſſimulation,</hi> Rom. 12.9. a Love that is <hi>fervent,</hi> and <hi>with a pure heart,</hi> 1 Pet. 1.22. A Love which does not lie in <hi>Word</hi> and in <hi>Tongue,</hi> but in <hi>Deed</hi> and in <hi>Truth,</hi> 1 Joh. 3.18.
<pb n="140" facs="tcp:59207:79"/>Now though we do make pretences of Love to one another, yet it is much to be feared that we do frequently but pretend it, and that under this great pretence of kindneſs there does frequently lurk a ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cret root of bitterneſs. Now notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding Charity be a moſt extenſive Grace, yet I ſhall conſider it at this time as it does import theſe two things.</p>
               <p>Firſt, a readineſs to do our Neighbour good.</p>
               <p>Secondly, to forgive evil: For where there is a true Love we ſhall be ready to <hi>give,</hi> and <hi>forgive;</hi> to do all the good we can, and forgive all the evil which is done againſt us. Theſe two will make our love to one another like the love of God to us, who does not only forgive our offences, but does alſo load us daily with his bene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fits.</p>
               <p>Firſt, we ſhall be ready to do our Neighbour all the good we can if we do love him as we ſhould. And if we would make a right judgment of the ſincerity of this love which we bear our Neighbour, we muſt judge of it by that love which we bear our ſelves; for we are ſtrictly ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liged to <hi>Love our Neighbour, as we love our
<pb n="141" facs="tcp:59207:79"/>ſelves,</hi> Mat. 22.39. Now before we can be ſaid to do this we muſt.</p>
               <p n="1">(1.) Wiſh our Neighbour the ſame good which we wiſh to our ſelves: We muſt have the ſame ſincere affection to our Neighbour, which we have to our ſelves. This muſt be the ſtandard by which we are to meaſure our love. And as it is very eaſie to diſcern that we do very ſincerely wiſh well to our ſelves, ſo muſt we do by our Neighbour alſo before we can be ſaid to love him as we love our ſelves. And this muſt be underſtood in the greateſt la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>titude. Certain it is that we wiſh well in the general to our own ſouls, to our Bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies, our Credit and Eſtate, though we many times uſe not the means which tend to their welfare; we muſt do thus as ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerely by our Neighbour alſo. And</p>
               <p n="2">(2.) We muſt in all our actions do by him as we in the like caſe ſhould, or may reaſonably deſire that he ſhould do by us. This we muſt inviolably obſerve before we can be ſaid to love our Neighbour as we do love our ſelves. And it is a very plain caſe that we would not that our Neighbour ſhould invade our juſt rights, and therefore if we love him as we love our ſelves, we ſhall be as careful not to
<pb n="142" facs="tcp:59207:80"/>invade his. If we are in miſery or want, we ſhall be glad of our Neighbours com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paſſion and relief; and when we love him as our ſelves we ſhall as readily afford him ours. We ſhall be very ready to preſerve our Neighbours credit, to put a fair inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pretation upon his actions, to relieve his wants, to bewail his miſery, to farther the Eternal welfare of his Soul, if we do love him as our ſelves. And indeed it will not avail us, that we do pretend to love our Neighbour, if we do not help him, and do him good. <hi>If a Brother or Siſter be naked, and deſtitute of daily Food; and one of you ſay unto them, depart in peace; be you warmed and filled; notwithſtanding ye give them not thoſe things which are need<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful to the Body; what doth it profit?</hi> Jam. 2.15, <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>6. Certainly we are devoid of love to Our Neighbour, if we do him not good as we have an opportunity. <hi>Whoſe hath this Worlds good, and ſeeth his Bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther have need, and ſhutteth up his Bowels of compaſſion from him, how dwelleth the love of God in him?</hi> 1 Joh. 3.17. If we love our Neighbour we ſhall moſt readily do him good, and we ſhall always ſtand rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy to do good offices to all with whom we ſhall converſe. And,</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="143" facs="tcp:59207:80"/>Secondly, we muſt forgive the evil which our Neighbour does to us. This we muſt alſo heartily do before we can worthily partake of this Holy Sacrament. And I ſhall ſhew

               <p n="1">1. Forgiveneſs implyes more than a bare profeſſion of kindneſs: This is a ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry common thing, and may well be ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed to take place amongſt thoſe that yet remain very great enemies: It is common to make great proteſtations of an hearty reconcilement. Our Saviour requires that we forgive one another <hi>from our hearts,</hi> Mat. 18.35.</p>
               <p n="2">2. Forgiveneſs implyes more than a bare abſtaining from making ſpiteful returns: There may be a <hi>ſecret malice</hi> where there is no <hi>viſible injury</hi> done: We are obliged to love our enemy, 'tis not enough that we do him no harm.</p>
               <p n="3">3. Forgiveneſs implyes more than doing kindneſſes to our Brother. It does indeed
<pb n="144" facs="tcp:59207:81"/>require a readineſs to do this, but yet the doing kindneſſes to our enemy is no cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain argument that we have forgiven him. We may be bountiful and liberal, and yet devoid of Charity, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 13.1. We may <hi>give,</hi> and yet not <hi>forgive.</hi> And perhaps we may do our enemy a kindneſs out of pride and vain-glory, or elſe we triumph over his miſery, and rejoyce that he who was before the object of our <hi>envy,</hi> is now become the object of our <hi>pity.</hi>

We eaſily forgive little offenders, and the ſmaller faults of our Neighbour: But the ſincere Chriſtian does more than this; he forgives not only a profeſſed enemy, but a treacherous and falſe friend; not only him that deſpiſes him, but the moſt curſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing <hi>Shimei</hi> that reproaches him to the face. His Charity <hi>beareth all things,</hi> 1 Cor. 13.7.</p>
               <p n="2">2. He is ſo far from taking revenge that his mind is free from all the intention of it. The leaven of malice is quite purged out of his heart; he is ſo far from watching an opportunity of miſchief that he deſires it not. And ſo far from doing
<pb n="145" facs="tcp:59207:81"/>evil that ſuch is his Charity, <hi>he thinketh no evil,</hi> 1 Cor. 13.5.</p>
               <p n="3">3. He does heartily pity his Enemy, and pray for him: And in this is a follow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er of the Precept, and of the example of his Bleſſed Saviour, <hi>Mat.</hi> 5.44. <hi>Luke</hi> 23.34. He does not only not requite his ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies with evil, but he returns him good; <hi>As for me when they were ſick, my clothing was ſackcloth; I humbled my Soul with faſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, and my Prayer returned into mine own boſom: I behaved my ſelf as though he had been my Friend, or Brother: I bowed down heavily as one that mourneth for his Mother,</hi> Pſal. 35.13, 14.</p>
               <p n="4">4. He does not only forgive but forget. He is moſt willing to let the remembrance of the injuries he hath received paſs away. And as a proof of this, he is moſt ready to do his enemy a kindneſs, and that out of no other deſign at all but a ſenſe of his duty, and a real Love which he finds in himſelf towards him. He does not do it out of oſtentation, nor with a purpoſe to upbraid him with ingratitude, or enhance his guilt, but meerly becauſe he loves him, and deſires his welfare with no leſs ſince<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity than he does his own. And ſtill as a farther demonſtration that he forgets the
<pb n="146" facs="tcp:59207:82"/>injury received, he is moſt ready to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtore his enemy to the ſame degree of Love which he had before he did the wrong: He is willing to admit him to the ſame kindneſs which he enjoyed before; aye, and to the ſame truſt and confidence alſo upon his Repentance, or the probable in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dications of it. In one word he does not retain any thing of malice or ill-will, but on the other hand finds in himſelf a moſt ſincere love and good will, and by all his actions does ſhew the great ſincerity of it.</p>
               <p>No leſs than ſuch a forgiveneſs does the Goſpel require, no leſs does the true Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtian find in himſelf: And certainly it cannot be any thing ſhort of this: For we muſt forgive as we deſire God to for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>give: And ſure I am we deſire from Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven no leſs than ſuch a forgiveneſs, and muſt therefore think our ſelves obliged to do no otherwiſe by our Brother, than we would that God ſhould do by us. For in this matter that is the Rule we are to go by, we are to imitate God, to forgive our offending Brother, <hi>Even as God for Chriſts ſake hath forgiven us,</hi> Eph. 4.32.</p>
               <p>Secondly, I come to ſhew what great reaſon we have to forgive our brother,
<pb n="147" facs="tcp:59207:82"/>when we come to this Sacrament. Now that I ſhall ſhew in the following Seve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rals.</p>
               <p n="1">1. Becauſe in this Sacrament we keep in remembrance the death of Chriſt. This was one great end of its Inſtitution, and this does ſtrongly oblige us to forgive our brother: Whether we conſider the death of Chriſt.</p>
               <p n="1">(1.) In it ſelf, as obliging us to put a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way all our ſins for which he dyed. It is but reaſon we ſhould put away our ſins which put our Lord to death. And if he dyed for ſin, then ought we by no means to live in it. If we do, we crucifie our Lord afreſh, and are more cruel to him than <hi>Judas</hi> or <hi>Pontius Pilate.</hi> We make his pains of no effect, and ſhew our ſelves void of all pity to our bleeding Saviour. They were our ſins that put him to his ſhame, and to his ſorrow; and if we re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain them we do but trample upon his pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious blood, we are very wretched Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures if we maintain his enemies, and add to his ſorrowes. He did not dye for ſins that we might live in them, but that we might dye to them. His Death is a very forcible argument againſt the life of our luſts, and a great motive to obedience.
<pb n="148" facs="tcp:59207:83"/>We little regard our dying Lord if we at once remember his Death, and break his Lawes.</p>
               <p n="2">(2.) Again, our Lord at his Death gave us a very great example of forgiveneſs of enemies; and therefore when we remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber his death, we have very great reaſon to forgive our offending brother. Our bleſſed Lord met with great enemies, and ſuch as had the greateſt reaſon to be his friends. He that eat of his bread lift up his heel againſt him. He was betrayed by his own Diſciple, delivered to death by him that pronounced him innocent, ſcourg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed and mocked by a rude and heady mul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>titude. He is numbred among Tranſgreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſors who had committed no ſin. He was hanged on the Tree who had never taſted the forbidden Fruit. He was put to death by thoſe whom he came to ſeek, and to ſave: He had done them many kindneſſes whilſt he was among them. He healed their ſick, fed their hungry, reſtored their blind, diſpoſſeſſed their Daemoniacks, and raiſed their dead. He offended none of their Laws. He paid <hi>Caeſar</hi> his Tribute, took care the Prieſt ſhould have his Offer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, obſerved their cuſtoms, went to their Feſtivals, and was ſo far from profaning
<pb n="149" facs="tcp:59207:83"/>their Temple, that he ſhewed a great zeal for defending it from common uſes. There could be nothing ſaid againſt his Doctrine, nothing againſt his Life. His enemies that bare witneſs againſt him could not agree, and it was infinitely plain that he was in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nocent: And yet his Countrymen thirſt after his blood, and prefer a Murderer be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore him. They want patience when our Lord wanted none: They cry out, <hi>Cru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cifie him, crucifie him:</hi> And what does our Lord do? he cryes out too, but not for Vengeance, but for Mercy, <hi>Father for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>give them for they know not what they do,</hi> Luk. 23.34. Certainly then we ſhould be aſhamed to remember theſe things with malice in our hearts; well may we for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>give our enemies when our Lord hath for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>given his. We muſt not dare to remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber the Death of Chriſt, and to remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber our Neighbours unkindneſs together. We may not think of revenge when our Lord ſhewed ſo much mercy. We can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not rightly remember Chriſts Death, when we do not imitate his example. He taught us what we ſhould do by what he did him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf. We ſhall look very unlike our Lord, if we retain our malice and ill-will.</p>
               <p n="3">
                  <pb n="150" facs="tcp:59207:84"/>(3.) If we conſider that Chriſts Death was not only for ſins, but alſo for our ſins, we ſhall ſtill find a greater obligation upon us to forgive one another. God gave his Son to dye, than which there cannot be a greater miracle of Love, and if God <hi>ſo loved us, we alſo ought to love one another,</hi> 1 Joh. 4.11. It was for us our Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viour laid down his life, and who are we! Had we deſerved this love! were we his friends, that he was at this pains and coſt! No ſurely, but we were ſinners and ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies, and yet he laid down his life for us, <hi>Rom.</hi> 5.8, 10. If then Chriſt dyed for his enemies, we ought to forgive <hi>ours,</hi> and then eſpecially we are obliged to do it, when we pretend to remember the Death of Chriſt: How can we now pull our bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther by the throat for a few <hi>pence,</hi> when our Lord hath forgiven us ſo many <hi>Talents?</hi> We are very ungrateful for our Lords kindneſs, if we are unkind to one ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther. Did we but conſider Gods mercies to us we ſhould think our ſelves obliged to be merciful to one another. And me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thinks it ſhould be eaſie for us to forgive our Neighbour, if we did but conſider how very much we need Gods forgive<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, and how far we are from deſerv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing it. If our Lords eye have been ſo
<pb n="151" facs="tcp:59207:84"/>good to us, why ſhould ours be evil to one another! what miſerable wretches ſhould we be if Gods mercies to us had not been greater than ours is to one another! He hath forgiven us our great ſcores, let us not retain then our grudges to our bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther. For ſhame then let us purge out this leaven of malice when we keep this Feaſt. Let us ſhew our ſelves kind to each other when we do remember the kindneſs of our Bleſſed Saviour. Beſides, our brothers of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fences againſt us are ſmall in reſpect to ours againſt God. We offend againſt an infi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nite Majeſty, we tranſgreſs the Eternal Laws of Reaſon. How coldly do we pray to him for the greateſt Bleſſings! How in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſenſible are we of his many mercies! How very ſtupid and incorrigible under his ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vereſt judgments! How void of the love of him, who hath loved us ſo much! If he ſhould mark iniquities how ſhould we be able to ſtand! We are not able to an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwer for one of a thouſand: But yet we hope for Mercy upon our Repentance and our Faith: We expect pardon from God for all theſe amiſſes: And had we not this hope we ſhould be of all men the moſt mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerable. We have then very great reaſon to be reconciled to our brother, when we ſtand in ſo great need that God ſhould be
<pb n="152" facs="tcp:59207:85"/>reconciled unto us; and when we hope for the pardon of our ſins from God, which we do from Chriſts death, and at this time when we do commemorate it, we have a ſufficient motive to forgive our brother. Eſpecially our Saviour having ſaid, <hi>If you forgive men their treſpaſſes your Heavenly Father will aſo forgive you. But if ye forgive not men their Treſpaſſes, neither will your Father forgive your treſpaſſes,</hi> Mat. 6.14, 15.</p>
               <p n="2">2. Another great end of this Sacrament is that Chriſtians may be knit together in the ſtricteſt bond of Love and Charity. It is as I ſhewed you before, a Feaſt of Love: It was deſigned to bring us toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, and to make us all of one heart. And a very effectual inſtrument it is, were it rightly underſtood and uſed, to that end and purpoſe. It would ſoon make us one again: It would bring together thoſe who now are ſeparated from one another. When Communions were frequent in the Church Chriſtians loved one another, and kept together: But when they became more ſeldom ſelemnized, then the feuds among the profeſſors of Chriſtianity grew alſo: For indeed this Sacrament was in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended to maintain us in Love and Cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity. And therefore if we do not hearti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
<pb n="153" facs="tcp:59207:85"/>forgive our brother, we do deſtroy alſo this end of its Inſtitution. It is very in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>decent to ſee men at odds that eat and drink at the ſame common Table. But it is a great wickedneſs to come to this Holy Ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble with malice and ill-will to our brother in our hearts. We muſt not keep this <hi>feaſt</hi> of <hi>love,</hi> with the <hi>leaven</hi> of <hi>malice.</hi> VVe cannot partake of this Sacrament but we muſt profeſs a kindneſs to our brother; and if we mean it not we are like <hi>Judas,</hi> that gave his Maſter good words when he was ready to betray him; and ſhall be mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerable as he was, into whom the Devil and the morſel entered at once. VVe ſhall find Death here, if we do not cleanſe our hearts from malice and ill-will. More might be ſaid to ſhew what reaſon we have to forgive our brother, before we partake of this Sacrament, but I ſhall ſay no more, only adding the words of our Saviour. <hi>Therefore if thou bring thy gift to the Altar, and there remembreſt that thy bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther hath ought againſt thee; leave there thy gift before the Altar, and go thy way, first be reconciled to thy brother, and then come and offer thy gift,</hi> Mat. 5.23, 24.</p>

               <head>CHAP. X.</head>
               <p>I Should now proceed to ſhew how we are to behave our ſelves when we do Communicate, when we have firſt exami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned the ſtate and condition of our Souls. But yet before I do proceed to that, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe we may ſtand in need of ſome far<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther ſupplies before we do actually Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>municate, I ſhall not omit to add ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing for our aſſiſtance that way.</p>
               <p n="1">1. Perhaps a man after the peruſal of what hath been ſaid before may not be able to determine whether he be fit to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive or not: And in caſe he doubt of himſelf it may be asked what he is to do in that caſe: If he proceed under his doubt he may involve himſelf in a farther perplexity; and if he do not receive, he may fear that he neglects his duty towards God in letting ſlip ſo excellent an oppor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tunity of becoming better, and omitting ſo great a precept of the Goſpel. In this caſe then it is very adviſeable that he ſhould make uſe of a Spiritual guide for his farther direction. This will be his ſafeſt courſe certainly; and well it would be if this courſe were taken more frequently than it is. It might prevent many of thoſe
<pb n="155" facs="tcp:59207:86"/>miſcarriages which men now fall into. It is of great advantage to the Souls of men not to conceal their doubts and ſcruples. The hiding of them tends to their great trouble, if not many times, to their eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal ruin. God hath provided us with the Miniſters of his Word to conduct and guide us in the way to Heaven. This is the great end for which they are ſent, and we ought accordingly to make uſe of them. We do very readily conſult the Phyſician and the Lawyer, where our Lives or E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtates are in any danger. And certainly were our Souls as precious to us as our Bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies and our Wealth, we ſhould as readi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly take advice for them as we do for theſe. Our way to Heaven would not be ſo per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plexed would we uſe the means which the mercy of God hath provided for us. Now certain it is that God gave <hi>Apostles, Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phets, Evangelists,</hi> and <hi>ſome Pastors and Teachers; for the perfecting of the Saints, for the work of the Ministery, for the edifying of the body of Christ, Epheſ.</hi> 4.11, 12. If we love our Souls we ſhall do well to ſhew our utmoſt care of them; which we cannot be ſaid to do if we ſuffer our doubts to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>main, and do not uſe thoſe appointments which God hath ſo plentifully furniſhed us withal.</p>
               <p n="2">
                  <pb n="156" facs="tcp:59207:87"/>2. We muſt be careful that when we examine our ſelves, we take accounts of our ſelves for thoſe amiſſes which are not puniſhable by any Laws of men. We are not to abſolve and acquit our ſelves be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe the ſevereſt Laws of Men cannot cenſure us. We do greatly amiſs when yet the beſt Laws of Men cannot puniſh us for doing ſo. We ought to conſider how we ſpend our time, to examine whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther we ſpend it either idly or unprofita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly: We are alſo to enquire how we ſpend our Eſtates whether in works of mercy and neceſſity, or upon vain and gawdy things. We are to remember, that we muſt hereafter account for every talent which we have received of our Lord: and though we may ſo live that the beſt Laws of men cannot condemn us, nor yet the beſt men juſtly cenſure us; yet however we may be liable to a greater and more impartial Judg. We are at ſuch a time to examine and ſearch into all the ſecrets of our hearts. We muſt indeed be favour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able in our judgement of others, but it be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>comes us very ſeverely to judge our ſelves. And we muſt not only abſtain from evil but from all appearance of it; not only from things that are in themſelves <hi>evil,</hi> but that are of <hi>evil report.</hi> Such things as theſe
<pb n="157" facs="tcp:59207:87"/>are frequenting of Taverns, very gawdy and fantaſtick attire, great merriments and jollities, coſtly feaſts and entertainments, ſpending beyond our income and reve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nue as well as above our rank: Spending great portions of our time in Drollery and mirth, ſetting off our beauty with artifice and curioſity; an extraordinary niceneſs in our dreſs, and a great forwardneſs in following the mode and faſhion. Such things as theſe are muſt come under our Examination, for it is very much to be fear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed that in them we do tranſgreſs, and that our hearts may go aſtray from God. In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed we are by no means to condemn one another; we may not too haſtily judge our brother in this caſe; but yet it will well become us to examine our own hearts, and to be very jealous and ſuſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tious of our ſelves.</p>
               <p n="3">3. In making a Judgement of our ſelves we ought not only to conſider what we are when we are dreſt up for the Solemni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, but what we are in our ordinary con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſation. There are few men ſo profane, but they will put on a demure counte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance, and a fair outſide when they are going to the Table of the Lord: But we are not to meaſure our ſelves by that, but to conſider what we are at other times.
<pb n="158" facs="tcp:59207:88"/>The beſt way to judg of our ſelves is to do it by what we are in our ordinary conver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſation. There is a Mechanical Religion, and that is, when our devotion is raiſed by the ringing of a Bell, the return of a Solemni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, or elſe the menaces of death: but when theſe things are over we return to our old wonts, and are but what we were before. When a Sacrament draws nigh we look like Saints, we abſtain from our groſſer ſins, we put up ſome cold prayers to God, we are for a day or two before very re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerved and ſober, and we faſt it may be upon the veſpers of the Feſtival, and car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry our ſelves very reverently when we do communicate: But yet all this while our hearts are not changed, and our lives are the ſame, or worſe than they were before. And therefore we are not to judge of our ſelves by ſuch fits and pangs of devotion, but by the general courſe and tenour of our lives. Were we to chuſe the picture of a friend or wife (that I may uſe a Simi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>le of one of our Divines upon this argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment) if we would have a true picture we would have it drawn as ſhe uſes to look in the ordinary management of her huſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wifery, not as ſhe looked when ſhe was dreſſed up with all the advantages and tricks of Art. We muſt do ſo by our
<pb n="159" facs="tcp:59207:88"/>ſelves, let us (if we would take a juſt eſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mate) reflect what we ordinarily are. The worſt of men at ſome times ſeem to be very good. There are but few men ſo ſtupid but ſomething or other does awa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken them to a ſenſe of things, and yet theſe men remain very bad and ſenſleſs ſtill. We call that man a lunatick or mad-man who yet hath many lucid intervals when he can uſe his reaſon: And him we judg a Fool or Natural (as we call them) who is ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerally ſo in all his words and actions, tho ſometimes he may ſpeak good ſenſe, and make very ſmart replies upon us. A Fe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver retains its name though it do ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times intermit and be not one continual paroxyſm. There muſt be a great change in the blood before it be quite removed. 'Tis ſo in the caſe that is before us; there muſt not only be an intermiſſion of our ſins and ſinful affections, but an extinction of them before we can be ſaid to be new Creatures. And that we are which we are moſt generally in the courſe of our con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſations.</p>
               <p n="4">4. It is therefore adviſeable that before we do Communicate we make ſom experiments upon our ſelves. Let us try how we can reſiſt a temptation, and how we can over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come it. Let us inure our ſelves by de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grees
<pb n="160" facs="tcp:59207:89"/>to overcome our inordinate affecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons. Suppoſe that we are given to ſome exceſs of anger or intemperance or the like: Let us try our ſelves ſometime before how we can maſter our ſelves. And it will not be hard to do it if we do it gradually, and alwayes call in to our aſſiſtance the Divine aid. If we be given to anger and impati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence, let us try firſt how we can bear the evils and diſappointments of a day; which it will be no hard matter to do. Then let us take out a greater time and uſe our ſelves by degrees to bear the yoke. If we find that we get the maſtery then may we expect a very great aid by communica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting, as well as a great encouragement to communicate frequently. The <hi>Jews</hi> we commanded to keep the day of expiation,<note place="margin">Joina c. <hi>8.</hi> Mi<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

<pb n="161" facs="tcp:59207:89"/>of this and the other precepts. And this courſe we ſhall do well to take with our Souls: Who may do well by degrees to wont them to obedience; and not to venture upon Communicating (whereby we are moſt ſolemnly obliged to obey all the precepts of Chriſt) before we have had ſome proof of our obedience.</p>
               <p n="5">5. It is alſo very adviſeable that at this time we do more particularly deſign the deſtroying that luſt which does moſt con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtantly annoy us, and eaſily beſet us. We have our peculiar luſts and follies to which we are addicted: Some ſins there are that are frequent temptations to us and do greatly moleſt and trouble us. It will be wiſdom at this time to ſet our ſelves main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly againſt that ſin. Where we are weak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt we ſhall do well to ſet the ſtrongeſt guard and watch. Our bodies are not more naturally prone to their peculiar diſtempers than our Souls are to their par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular follies. And certainly if we can deſtroy theſe fiercer enemies we ſhall not need fear the other aſſailants. And there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore let us eſpecially ſet our ſelves againſt thoſe luſts that do very often ſolicite and importune us. For as it is great wiſdom to conſider where we are weak and eaſily overcome, ſo is it no leſs wiſdom to raiſe
<pb n="162" facs="tcp:59207:90"/>up all our force and ſtrength to defend our ſelves againſt thoſe ſpiritual enemies which do moſt eaſily prevail upon us.</p>
               <p n="6">6. Let us endeavour to put our ſelves into ſuch a preparation as we would be found in when we are to die. For cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainly we are not fit to Communicate if we are not fit to dye. The ſame pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paration is required for a Communion which is for our death. And many devout perſons have very wiſely at once diſpoſed themſelves for the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiving this Sacrament and their diſſolution alſo.<note place="margin">v. Calvin. Epiſt. 99.</note> Now certain it is that though we trifle in our lives yet we be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come ſerious when we come to die. Then we do recollect our ſelves, and very ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verely examine our own Conſciences. Then we pray very earneſtly, give very earneſt attention to Gods word, and very ſeriouſly heed what we are about. And did we as verily believe that we ſhould forthwith reſign up our Souls unto God, we ſhould be very careful to put them in a readineſs for ſo great a change. It will well become us at this time to conſider in what condition we would be found when our Lord calls us hence; and then to en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavour to our utmoſt that we may with no leſs diligence diſpoſe our ſelves for this
<pb n="163" facs="tcp:59207:90"/>ſervice than if we were preſently to give up the ghoſt. Thus if we do we ſhall not trifle in our preparations, but ſhall moſt carefully examine our hearts, and moſt earneſtly call in the Divine aid and aſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance.</p>

               <p>I Proceed now to ſhew how we are to behave our ſelves when we do Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>municate: And of that I ſhall ſpeak in the following Severals.</p>
               <p n="1">1. Firſt of all, we are to take care that our <hi>hearts be lifted up to the Lord,</hi> as we are exhorted by the man of God. Let us not ſuffer our thoughts to remain upon low and earthly things. Forget your worldly concerns and intereſts. Remember what an holy and ſolemn ſervice you are about. Attend now upon this very thing. When your worldly and trifling thoughts would thruſt in upon you preſently repell and beat them back. Tell them you are employed about greater matters, that they muſt ſtand off now while you worſhip your Lord; that your Souls are the houſes of prayer, and not a den of ſuch thieves.
<pb n="164" facs="tcp:59207:91"/>Suffer not theſe buſie intruders to have any entrance or countenance from you. By no means yield to any of their impor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tunities. Your Souls muſt aſcend up to Heaven now, and forget all earthly things. Your otherwiſe lawful thoughts you muſt now account profane. They muſt by no means come near when you are thus employed. We muſt do now as was done at the giving of the Law, bounds were ſet that nothing might approach the Mount under the ſevereſt penalty, <hi>Exod.</hi> 19. We muſt do ſo now we make this ſolemn approach unto God; we muſt be greatly careful that no evil or earthly thought draw nigh, and if they do we muſt ſeverely chaſtiſe them and beat them back. And as then 'twas forbidden to ſuffer either man or beaſt to touch that Mount, ſo we muſt here beware not only of our beaſtly and carnal thoughts, but alſo of all other thoughts (though at ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther time not unbecoming man-kind) which would diſturb our devotion, and draw us aſide from the contemplation of what we are about. We had need uſe our utmoſt care that we may attend upon God without diſtraction; elſe will our hearts before we are aware ſlide into vain or impertinent entertainments. And when
<pb n="165" facs="tcp:59207:91"/>they are once let looſe we ſhall not ſo ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry eaſily recollect them and bring them back. They will ſoon run into the ends of the earth, and if we be not watchful and reſolute, they will leave nothing but our bodies for ſo great a ſervice as this: Our hearts are treacherous, and our thoughts are like the ſervant of the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phet who ſecretly run after the <hi>Syrian</hi> for a talent of Silver, and two changes of rai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, without the leave of his maſter; and if we call them not in they'l contract a more diſmal leproſie than that ſervant did. We cannot let them gad abroad without a great loſs at ſuch a time as this. We may be aſſured they will fare as <hi>Dinah</hi> did, they will return defiled home. And therefore let us be ſure to ſet a ſtrict watch upon our ſelves, leſt our ſpiritual enemies ſteal away our hearts at ſuch a time as this. Let us lift them up to God, and there let them be kept whiles we worſhip his holy name.</p>
               <p n="2">2. When you approach to the Table of the Lord, endeavour to raiſe up your heart to the greateſt thankfulneſs to Almighty God for his undeſerved love to thee. O conſider how gracious thy Lord is unto thee a wretched ſinner: That he ſhould not only give thee his Son to die, but al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſo
<pb n="166" facs="tcp:59207:92"/>give thee his fleſh to eat. Not only re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive thee to pardon but alſo entertain thee at his own Table as his gueſt and friend. Say within thy ſelf. <q>Lord, what am I, that thou ſhouldeſt not on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly ſhew me pity, but do me ſo great a favour to receive me as thy friend. What a love is this that thou art plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed to ſhew to my Soul, when there are ſo many that have not heard of theſe thy mercies, ſo many that have foregone them. I may well wonder that thy mercy lets me live, that I have bread to eat, or thy air to breathe in; and yet thou art pleaſed to give me Angels food, and to feed me with bread from Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven. I am not worthy of the leaſt of thy mercies, but then this miracle of love may well overwhelm me. Who has ever heard of ſuch a love, of ſo great a condeſcenſion! Bleſs the Lord, O my Soul, and all that is within me bleſs his holy name: Let me never forget ſo great a mercy, never be ungrateful after ſuch a condeſcenſion of Heaven. What ſhall I render unto the Lord for ſuch an unſpeakable love as this, that he ſhould ſpread me a Table, and fill my Cup, who am unworthy of the crumbs that
<pb n="167" facs="tcp:59207:92"/>fall from his Table. Oh the height and depth, the length and breadth of this love which paſſeth knowledge!</q>
               </p>
               <p>It well becomes us thus to raiſe up our hearts to all thankfulneſs to God when we do approach to this Feaſt. For we do here commemorate the greateſt mercy that was ever ſhewed to Mankind. And it re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quires of us the greateſt praiſe and thankſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giving. This is a ſervice of praiſe; and therefore it is called the Euchariſt. And certainly if we think our ſelves obliged to commemorate our Benefactors and Friends, which we frequently do; we muſt think our ſelves much more obliged with all thankfulneſs to remember the love of our deareſt Lord, who dyed that we might live.</p>
               <p n="3">3. VVhen we ſee the Bread broken, and the Wine poured out, let us meditate at once upon the Paſſion of our Lord, and the hainous nature of our ſins that put him to that pain. Think you ſaw your deareſt Saviour hang upon the Croſs, that you were eye-witneſſes of the ſhame and ſorrow that he underwent. O think you ſaw the blood that he ſhed running down his Body; that you ſaw the Spear and the Nails that pierced his Hands, his Feet and Side. Call to mind the Agony that he
<pb n="168" facs="tcp:59207:93"/>was in, the ſorrowes that he underwent: Have ſome pity and regard to thy bleed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Lord; paſs not by, but ſee and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hold that there is no ſorrow like to his ſor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>row. Thy heart is very hard ſure if thou doſt not now relent. Thou art very de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>void of pity if thou haſt no compaſſion for thy bleeding Lord. But then remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber what it was that brought upon him all this ſorrow and ſhame that thou ſeeſt him in. Not any fault of his own, but thy ſins were the cauſe of it. They nail<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed him to his Croſs, they pierced his Side, they Crowned him with Thorns, and gave him Gall and Vinegar to drink, they did him the deſpight and the affronts which he endured. They were the <hi>Judas,</hi> the <hi>Pilate,</hi> the falſe Witneſſes, the chief Prieſts that contrived and accompliſhed his ſor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rowes. 'Twas thy Covetouſneſs that be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>traid him, thy unbelief and wickedneſs that brought him to his Croſs, and cauſed him to cry out, <hi>My God, my God, why haſt thou forſaken me?</hi> Raiſe up then a great indignation againſt thy ſins, as thou haſt any love or pity for thy dying Lord. Say thus to thine own heart: <q>Shall I not be aſhamed of thoſe ſins which put my Lord to ſo much ſhame! ſhall I not mourn for thoſe ſins which put him to ſo
<pb n="169" facs="tcp:59207:93"/>much pain! may not they well break my heart which have ſo deeply wound<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed and pierced my bleſſed Saviour! If he dyed for ſin well may I be aſhamed to live in it. If my ſins made him cry out, and bow the head, how ſhall I then give them any entertainment! Well may they be heavy on me which were ſo great a burden to my Lord. How have I made a ſport of that (vile wretch as I am) which made my Saviour ſweat drops of blood! Did my Saviour ſuffer ſuch pains that he might deſtroy ſin, and have not I harboured it? I have taken part with the moſt implacable enemies of my dying Lord. Alaſs, I have not conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered the ſorrowes of my Saviour, but like a vile wretch, I have Crucified him afreſh, I have trampled on his Blood, and done him open deſpight and ſhame. Methinks I ſee him hang on the Croſs, and methinks I hear him cry out to me, and bid me ſee whether there were ever ſuch a ſorrow, and alſo, that I ſhould not be ungrateful to forget his love. What an hard heart have I had that have had no more regard to him! Oh, that mine eyes were a fountain of tears, that I might mourn for my ſins that have Crucified my Lord. Sure my heart is
<pb n="170" facs="tcp:59207:94"/>very hard, if I do not mourn now for mine iniquities, when I behold my bleed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing and dying Saviour. I have tears for other things, have I none for my ſins, none for my Lord! I have ſometimes wept when I have thought of a dying Friend. Have I no tears for my dying Saviour, who dies that I may live! O my God ſmite this rocky heart of mine, that I may weep when I look upon him whom I have Crucified. Look upon me, my Lord, as thou didſt once upon thy Diſciple who denied thee, that I may be able to weep bitterly as he did.</q>
               </p>
               <p>It will well become us, when we com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>memorate the death of our Saviour, to be very deeply humbled for our ſins, which put him to death.</p>
               <p n="4">4. When thou receiveſt the Bread, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>new your Covenant with God. Conſent heartily to receive thy Saviour in all his Offices, of Prophet, Prieſt and King. De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſire earneſtly to be joyned to thy Lord in the ſtricteſt bond. Reſolve to give thy ſelf up intirely to the obedience of his Holy Laws: Beg of him that he would dwell in thine heart; give him the full poſſeſſion of thy ſelf. Tell him thou art his for the time to come, and that thou doſt willingly give him entrance and poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeſſion
<pb n="171" facs="tcp:59207:94"/>of thy whole heart. Say to him, <q>Lord I do heartily and joyfully entertain thee. And though I am unworthy that thou ſhouldeſt come under my roof; yet ſince it is thy condeſcenſion to viſit me a poor ſinner, I do moſt joyfully receive thee. Grant that I, who eat of thy Bread, may never lift up my heel againſt thee. And that though many Lords have ruled in me, I may henceforth on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly make mention of thy name. Strength<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>en my feeble Soul that I may perform my Vows: Help me that I may now be thine, and that <hi>I</hi> may continue in thy love. Be thou that to my Soul which bread is to my mortal and frail Body. Grant that my Soul and Body may be ſeparate, and for ever ſet apart to thy ſervice; ſuffer me not to profane, and unhallow what is thus ſolemnly conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crated to thee. I offer thee my heart; Lord, unite it to thy fear and ſervice. Grant it may no more run aſtray from thee, that it may not be ſeduced by the deceitfulneſs of ſin, by the allurements and blandiſhments of this wicked world, but continue conſtant and ſtedfaſt in thy Covenant. <hi>Create in me a clean heart, O God, and renew a right</hi> (or conſtant) <hi>ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit within me,</hi> 
                     <bibl>Pſal. 51.10.</bibl>

                  <pb n="172" facs="tcp:59207:95"/>5. When we receive the Cup, let us again renew our conſent that Chriſt ſhall rule over us And let us particularly me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditate upon the great danger of revolting and ſliding back: This is the blood of the New Covenant, the blood of the imma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culate Lamb of God, which was ſhed for us. It was an ancient cuſtom of entring into League and Covenants by ſlaying of beaſts, and ſhedding their blood; this was in token that he that failed to perform his part did devote himſelf to the like de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruction. Oh conſider then what a wrath hangs over thy head, if thou trample up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the blood of Jeſus! There will remain nothing but a <hi>certain fearful looking for of judgment and fiery indignation.</hi> And there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore conſider well, how greatly dangerous it will be for thee to diſobey thy Lord for the time to come. Say thus within thy ſelf: <q>
                     <hi>I</hi> am now renewing my Covenant with God, I do now undertake to obey the Laws of Chriſt, and make him a ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lemn promiſe of Obedience for the time to come. And that I may bind my ſelf the faſter to my Lord, I take the Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment upon it, I drink of this blood of the new Covenant. So that I am now bound in a ſtricter bond than ever; I have profeſſed a ſervice to him a great
<pb n="173" facs="tcp:59207:95"/>while, I have now liſted my ſelf, and as it were taken a Sacramental Oath that I will be faithful. This blood of my Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viour will witneſs againſt me if I fall back, and ſo the blood of Jeſus will be upon me if I prove unfaithful. And there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, O my Lord, look in Mercy upon me. Grant that I may not after all my other ſins, be guilty of the blood of Chriſt. That I may never have the blood of my Saviour to anſwer for. Then will my caſe be worſe than that of the <hi>Jews</hi> who Crucified him, but yet knew him not to be the Lord of Glory. But I know him, and am dedicated to his ſervice. My ſin for the future will be of a deeper dye. Grant Lord that I may not be guilty of the blood of Chriſt, that I may not put him to death that came to ſave my life, that his innocent blood may not cry to Heaven againſt me, and be laid to my charge. What a wretch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed Creature ſhall I be if my Saviour ſhall be my Accuſer. Thus may we meditate when we receive the Cup.</q>
               </p>
               <p>And indeed it will be a very ſeaſonable meditation; we ſhall be very wicked in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed if we do now return to our ſins and evil wonts, when we have not only eat the fleſh but drank the blood of Chriſt.
<pb n="174" facs="tcp:59207:96"/>The blood of Chriſt was ſhed for our re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſion and our pardon, but how ſad will it be with us if it be laid to our charge; if that blood from whence we expect our pardon ſhall cry for vengeance againſt us!

And how miſerable is that man who inſtead of re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiving pardon from Chriſts blood, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceives a greater guilt from it, and falls un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der that curſe which the <hi>Jews</hi> called on themſelves, when they ſaid, <hi>His blood be upon us and our children.</hi>

<pb n="175" facs="tcp:59207:96"/>for all Chriſtian Kings and Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernours who do greatly need our Prayers, and may very juſtly expect them alſo. And here we ſhall do well while we are attend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing upon this ſervice, to pray for our friends and relatives, and for thoſe who have de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſired our prayers. This is a Feaſt of love, and a greater expreſſion of our love to our brother we cannot give than to inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cede earneſtly for his Soul; and as we are alwayes obliged to do it, ſo are we more particularly bound to do it at this time when we commemorate the great love of our dying Saviour, which he expreſſed to the Souls of men. And we ſhall do well at this time to ſend up Ejaculations to God for them: Nor muſt we forget to pray for thoſe who are our enemies with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out a cauſe. This our Saviour did when he was upon the Croſs, and when we re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>member his Agonies we muſt not forget to do as he did. Let us heartily pray for them that God would forgive their ſins, and that he would turn their hearts. We are obliged to this both by the precept, and by the example of our deareſt Lord: Nor may we expect pardon for our offen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces, if we do not from our hearts forgive our brother his. Our hearts muſt be per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fectly cleared of all the leaven of malice

               <p>I Come now to ſhew how we muſt be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>have our ſelves after we have been par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>takers of this Table of our Lord. And that I ſhall do in the following Severals.</p>
               <p n="1">1. Let us out of gratitude for ſo great a favour from Gods hands, ſhew mercy to the poor. This the <hi>Jews</hi> did upon a feſtival,<note place="margin">Jom. Toff. c. <hi>1,</hi>
                  </note> and they give particular rules about it. It well becomes us when God hath vouch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſafed to entertain us at his Table, to en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tertain the poor at ours. We can make no amends to God for his mercy to us, but yet we may ſhew our gratitude by ſhew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing mercy to our poor brethren who bear his image. God hath ſubſtituted them to receive our grateful acknowledgements. This we ſhall cheerfully do if we have up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on our minds a lively ſenſe of the mercies of God to us, and of our unworthineſs of the leaſt of them. We read to this pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe what the firſt Chriſtians did. That <hi>they brake</hi> their <hi>bread, i. e.</hi> received the
<pb n="177" facs="tcp:59207:97"/>Lords Supper <hi>from houſe to houſe, and did eat their meat with gladneſs and ſingleneſs of heart,</hi> or liberality, <hi>praiſing God, and ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving favour with all the people,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">
                     <gap reason="foreign">
                        <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                     </gap>. Vid. Dr. <hi>Hammond</hi> in loc.</note> or (as it hath been thought thoſe words do import) exerciſing mercy and ſhewing kindneſs to thoſe that want<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed. We ſhall do well to imitate this ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ample; and when God ſhews us ſo much mercy, let us not be without compaſſion to one another. For verily if our hearts be hardened againſt our poor brother, we have great reaſon to think our ſelves void of the love of God.</p>
               <p n="2">2. Let us uſe an after examination. Let us preſently reflect and conſider what was amiſs in us when we were waiting upon our Lord, and humble our ſelves for it forth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>with. Otherwiſe it is to be feared we ſhall ſoon relapſe to our wonts, and be ſo far from being better that we ſhall be much worſe. If we do not rebuke our ſelves quickly we ſhall ſoon return to our vain Converſation again.</p>
               <p n="3">3. Let us by all means ſequeſter our ſelves from our worldly divertiſements and concerns, and employ our time in prayer and praiſes. It is very adviſable that we ſhould be alone, that we ſhould for ſome
<pb n="178" facs="tcp:59207:98"/>time ſeparate our ſelves from our worldly employments, and ſpend our time in our private devotions. Our Saviour after he had kept this Supper with his Diſciples, and ſung an Hymn or Pſalm of Praiſe after it, with-draws from his Diſciples, and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>takes himſelf to prayer unto God. And this he does three ſeveral times. The world will be very ready to thruſt in upon us, and to make us forget our vows and good reſolutions; we ſhall be in great dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger if we be not very cautelous. And therefore we muſt pertinaciouſly reſolve to watch over our hearts; and when our Souls are clean we muſt be greatly careful that we be not defiled again. We muſt do here as Phyſicians adviſe us to do when we uſe their preſcriptions, we muſt alſo take care that we uſe them <hi>cum regimine,</hi> we muſt not take cold, nor commit any other error, which will make their rules become ineffectual. When our houſe is ſwept and garniſhed we muſt take care that an unclean Spirit do not re-enter, leſt our latter end be worſe than our be ginning.</p>
               <p n="4">4. Let us be very careful that we do not relapſe and fall back into an evil courſe of life. Certain it is that it ſtands us in hand to uſe our utmoſt care to this pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe.
<pb n="179" facs="tcp:59207:98"/>We muſt do as the Spouſe did, when ſhe had found him whom her Soul loved, ſhe <hi>held him and would not let him go,</hi> Cant. 3.4. We muſt not only re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive our Lord Jeſus but we muſt alſo walk in him. We muſt for the time to come devote our ſelves to the ſervice of our Lord. We muſt ſet our ſelves upon the obedience of all his precepts, and up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the mortifying all our evil and corrupt affections. We muſt inure our ſelves to the works of Religion, and the labours of a pious life: We muſt uſe our ſelves to bear the Croſs, to forgive injuries, to bri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dle our anger, to croſs our carnal deſires and appetites, and contradict the cravings of the Animal life. If we preſently return to our ſins again, we ſhew that we have but played the part of hypocrites and diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſemblers, and ſhall pay dear for our hy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pocriſie. Our condition will be very ſad if we now return to our vomit. Let us therefore renew our purpoſes of a new life, and be greatly careful that we return no more to folly. We may reaſon thus with our ſelves when we are retired into our Cloſets: <q>I have now once more renew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed my Covenant with God: I have pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſed him ſolemnly that I will be his ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vant: I have, to bind my ſelf the faſter,
<pb n="180" facs="tcp:59207:99"/>taken the body and blood of my Lord. I am now faſt bound to be conſtant and faithful to him. Sure I am that God with whom I have had to do, is a God that will not be mocked. I may de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive others, him I cannot deceive. What a wretched creature ſhall I be if I ſhould now prove falſe! What cords will hold me if I break this! How can I think that God will ever truſt me, or how can I ever truſt my ſelf if I now relapſe! The blood of Chriſt will call for vengeance againſt me if I now run on in my former courſes. My ſins were great before, but now they will be ag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gravated. Wo is me if I now run on in my exceſs of folly. Shall I ſuffer any corrupt ſpeech to proceed out of that mouth which hath received my Lord? Shall <hi>I</hi> abuſe my body to intemperance which my Lord hath entered into! How ſhall <hi>I</hi> ever look my Lord in the face if <hi>I</hi> ſhould now betray him or de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny him! Good God, look upon thy ſervant, and whatever plagues <hi>I</hi> meet with in this world ſuffer me not to for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſake thee: Have pity upon me O God, and let me not ſtart aſide from thy pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cepts. Let me die rather than <hi>I</hi> ſhould deny thee. Suffer me not ſo far to diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>honour
<pb n="181" facs="tcp:59207:99"/>thy name, and wrong my own Soul: Let thy grace be ſufficient for me; do thou give me power that <hi>I</hi> may keep thy ſtatutes at all times.</q>
               </p>
               <p>Thus may we reaſon with our ſelves when we come to our Cloſets, after we have received the Body and Blood of our Lord. And we ſhall find it very needful to awaken our ſelves to a new obedience, as we would avoid the greateſt indignation of Heaven. For certain it is if we willful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly return to our follies again, we ſhall bring great wrath upon our ſelves. And though perhaps we may not be puniſhed with ſickneſs and ſudden death, as the <hi>Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rinthians,</hi> were for the abuſe of this Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, (1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 11.30.) yet are there more diſmal plagues than theſe, which will over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>take us; ſuch are hardneſs of heart, blind<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of mind, a reprobate ſenſe, and a ſear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed Conſcience: Theſe are indeed <hi>deaf strokes,</hi> and ſuch as make not a noiſe, and ſtrike not our ſenſes; but yet, if we con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſider the effect and conſequence of them, they are more formidable and diſmal than the raging peſtilence, or the loudeſt claps of thunder. Let us then reſolve, as we love our Souls or fear the wrath of God, to ſin no more leſt the worſt of things come upon us. But let us thus judge that
<pb n="182" facs="tcp:59207:100"/>
                  <hi>Chriſt died for all, that they which live ſhould not henceforth live unto themſelves, but unto him which died for them and roſe again,</hi> 2 Cor. 5.15. The Body and Blood of Chriſt will not ſave us whiles we continue in our ſins. Nor may we think that this Sacrament will ſecure us if we return to our follies. <hi>I</hi> ſhall end this particular with the words of <hi>Syracides, He that waſheth himſelf after the touching of a dead body, if he touch it again what availeth his waſhing? So is it with a man that fasteth for his ſins, and go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth again and doth the ſame; who will hear his prayer, or what doth his humbling profit him?</hi> Ecclus. 34.25, 26.</p>

               <p n="1">1. This duty ſtands upon the ſame au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority which the other precepts of Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtianity do. He that commands us to Pray, to ſearch the Scriptures, to hear
<pb n="183" facs="tcp:59207:100"/>Gods Word, and to take heed how we hear, hath as plainly commanded us to <hi>do this.</hi> We are no more left at liberty here than we are in the other precepts of Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtianity. And certainly it is an argument of great inſincerity, to pick and chuſe which of Chriſts commands we will obey. Beſides, by breaking one command we make our ſelves guilty of all, becauſe we do deſpiſe the authority on which the reſt ſtand. <hi>For whoſoever ſhall keep the whole Law, and yet offend in one point is guilty of all: For he that ſaid, do not commit Adul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tery; ſaid alſo do not kill. Now if thou commit no Adultery, yet if thou kill thou art become a tranſgreſſor of the Law,</hi> Jam. 2.10, 11. I am ſure the command is very plain and evident, <hi>Do this, Luk.</hi> 22.19. 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 11.24, 25. and <hi>verſe</hi> 28. <hi>Let a man ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>amine himſelf, and ſo let him eat of this bread and drink of this cup.</hi> To examine our ſelves is a confeſt duty, and therefore by a juſt conſequence ſo it is to eat of this Bread and Drink of this Cup. That duty is relative to this: If we do that we are bound to do this alſo. And though we ſhould neglect that, yet will not that ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuſe our neglect of this, any more than one fault is a juſt excuſe for the commit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting of another. <hi>I</hi> doubt not but that we
<pb n="184" facs="tcp:59207:101"/>do divers things, and think our ſelves o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bliged to do them alſo from the Laws of Chriſt, for which we have no ſuch clear command from the Laws of Chriſt as we have for this. And therefore certainly if we do not this it is not for want of <hi>plain Scripture</hi> that requires it, but for ſome other cauſe beſt known to God and our own Conſciences. But in the mean time we may be aſhamed to call Chriſt, <hi>Lord, Lord;</hi> and he may juſtly upbraid us for it, when we refuſe to <hi>do whatſoever he com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mands us,</hi> Luk. 6.46. Let us not for ſhame call our ſelves Chriſtians when we will not obey the Laws of Chriſt. <hi>Ye are my friends if ye do whatſoever I command you,</hi> Joh. 15.14. It is not a partial obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience to the Laws of Chriſt, will be ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficient to make us the genuine Diſciples of our Lord and Saviour. If we would be thought to belong to him we muſt obey him in all his commands. Unleſs we do ſo we cannot be ſecure. For though we do ſome of thoſe duties which Chriſt hath com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded, yet, if we do neglect him in o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers, we are not ſuch Chriſtians as we ought to be. There are thoſe indeed who think themſelves obliged by the Moral precepts of the Goſpel, and are in great meaſure careful that they tranſgreſs not
<pb n="185" facs="tcp:59207:101"/>thoſe Laws, which are indeed the <hi>Laws of Nature,</hi> as well as the <hi>Laws of Chriſt;</hi> but yet theſe men neglect this <hi>inſtitution</hi> of Chriſt, and are not much concerned in the mean time; and that becauſe they do not tranſgreſs the <hi>Law of Nature</hi> though they do tranſgreſs the <hi>poſitive</hi> Law of <hi>Chriſt.</hi> But theſe men ought to conſider that the <hi>Law</hi> of <hi>Nature</hi> is not the adaequate and full rule of their Conſcience: They muſt alſo attend to the <hi>Divine Revelation,</hi> and to the inſtitutions of Chriſt. This precept of partaking of the Communion is peculiarly the Law of Chriſt. And to do this is the mark and badg of Chriſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans. By doing it we ſhew whoſe follow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers we are. And we are particularly obli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged to do it as we do profeſs our ſelves Chriſtians. And the ſame Authority that obliges us to the obſervance of any other Law of Chriſt, does oblige us to do this alſo. And therefore if we think our ſelves bound to any Chriſtian duties, we judge very much amiſs if we think our ſelves un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>concerned in this.</p>
               <p n="2">2. This duty is built upon as great a reaſon, if we conſider the end of its inſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tution, as any other of the ſame nature is. I ſay as great a reaſon, I ſhall not need to ſay a greater. It was appointed in remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brance
<pb n="186" facs="tcp:59207:102"/>of the death of Chriſt, that miracle of mercy and love. <hi>As often as ye eat this bread and drink this Cup, ye do ſhew the Lords death till he come,</hi> 1 Cor. 11.26. It is to keep in mind our Lords death for which this Sacrament was appointed; this methinks we ſhould be ready to do who expect ſuch benefits from his death, and know that he died that we might live. We eaſily fulfil the deſires of a dying friend: But if our friend died in our quarrel and defence we know not how to forget him; and he that does forget ſuch a friend is re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>puted juſtly a moſt ungrateful wretch: How then can we forget the dear love of our dy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Lord? We keep in memory our Tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poral victories and deliverances, and we think we do well in it alſo: How much greater reaſon have we to keep in mind this deliverance from eternal death and ſlavery? This is never to be forgotten cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainly, but ought to be kept in memory as long as this world endures. But then our dying Saviour, who might have required of us ſome more burdenſome ſervice if he had pleaſed, hath commanded us to do this, &amp; to do it in remembrance of him: he would have us remember his love to us, and he lets us know how he would have us remember his love, <hi>Do this in remembrance of me.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="3">
                  <pb n="187" facs="tcp:59207:102"/>3. 'Tis a duty the practice whereof is as advantageous to our Souls, if we con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſider our own neceſſities, as any whatſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever. We have need of ſuch helps and viands in our pilgrimage towards Heaven. This repaſt will give us new ſtrength and vigor. And we greatly need that our ſtrength ſhould be renewed. This is a bleſſed opportunity of renewing our Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venant with God, and reconciling our ſelves to one another, and dreſſing up our diſordered Souls for another World. This puts us upon exciting all our Graces, and ſtrengthening all our good purpoſes and intentions: This <hi>awakens</hi> our <hi>repent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance, inflames</hi> our <hi>charity, augments</hi> our <hi>hope, confirms</hi> our <hi>faith,</hi> and puts us into a condition that makes us more fit to live, and more prepared to dye. We are like Clocks and Watches that frequently ſtand in need of winding up, and ſetting right: Or elſe like trees that are apt to be pulled back by ſuckers, and burdened with lux<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uriant branches: This bleſſed Sacrament puts us upon amending all our amiſſes, it puts us upon cutting off, and paring away our excreſcencies and ſuperfluities. How glad ſhould we be then of ſuch an excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent opportunity, that does oblige us up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
<pb n="188" facs="tcp:59207:103"/>pain of death to become new creatures; and we are offered ſtrength and grace to be ſo. Who need perſwade the hungry man to eat, or the thirſty to drink! If we underſtand our needs they will put us forward. When our Souls grow diſor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered we ſhould be glad of an opportuni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty of ſetting them right: When our ſins grow upon us, and our Charity grows cold, we ſhould be glad of an occaſion to renew our Repentance, and enflame our Charity. Here's a bleſſed occaſion that puts us upon all this: This calls upon us to break off our wont of ſin, to kindle our dying charity, to forget our quarrels and contentions, and to put our ſelves in a po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſture for a better life than this. Here is a great grace offered, and conferred to them that come prepared.</p>
               <p>So that we ſee what great neceſſity lies upon us to do this. We have a plain and peremptory command to do it; a great reaſon alſo to enforce the Precept; and after all this, our own intereſt and advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tage does loudly require it of us. So plain a Precept we may not neglect without open <hi>rebellion</hi> againſt our Lord. Nor can we reſiſt the reaſon of it without being guilty of great <hi>ingratitude:</hi> And after this, if
<pb n="189" facs="tcp:59207:103"/>we are not perſwaded to it by our own intereſt we are <hi>falſe to our own ſouls.</hi> Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thinks any of theſe are ſtrong enough: And it will be very ſtrange if all of them together ſhould not draw us. If the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand of Chriſt, and the ſenſe of his dear love, and our own intereſt beſides will not draw us, certainly our hearts are very hard.</p>
               <p n="4">4. To what hath been ſaid I add this, that the <hi>Jew</hi> was moſt ſtrictly obliged to keep the Paſſover, and he that did neg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lect it was liable to the ſevereſt penalty. And we have therefore great reaſon to think, the neglecter of this Precept of our Lords makes himſelf obnoxious to the wrath of God, by reaſon of this neglect. For the Paſſover, we know that every <hi>Iſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raelite</hi> was obliged to keep it, <hi>Exod.</hi> 12.47. And becauſe it might happen that ſome of them might be by reaſon of their <hi>legal de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>filement</hi> unfit; or elſe by reaſon of <hi>ſome journey</hi> from <hi>home, unable</hi> to keep it in that place where it was commanded to be kept; therefore it was provided in the Law that the ſecond Moneth ſhould be obſerved, and in it the ſecond Paſſover kept, for the ſake of ſuch men as theſe that were unavoidably hindred from keep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
<pb n="190" facs="tcp:59207:104"/>it in the firſt moneth. But this Paſſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver was only ſubſtituted in the caſe above-named. For every <hi>Iſraelite</hi> was obliged to keep the firſt Paſſover, if he were clean and not in a journey, and made himſelf greatly obnoxious if he did not. Thus we read, <hi>the man that is clean, and is not in a journey, and forbeareth to keep the Paſſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>over; even the ſame Soul ſhall be cut off from his people, becauſe he brought not the of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fering of the Lord in his appointed ſeaſon: That man ſhall bear his ſin,</hi> Numb. 9.13. And in caſe he were in a journey or un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clean yet did not this excuſe him; he was however obliged to keep the Paſſover un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the Lord, <hi>v.</hi> 10. And that he might do ſo the ſecond Paſſover was inſtituted, <hi>Numb.</hi> 9. The <hi>Iſraelites</hi> were ſeverely obliged to keep the Paſſover, and to keep it aright. He that did not keep that Feaſt was to be <hi>cut off</hi> from Gods people, and he that eat leavened bread during that Feaſt, was likewiſe liable to the ſame penalty. <hi>Exod.</hi> 12.15. So that it was commanded to be kept, and to be kept as was appoin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted upon pain of the greateſt curſe. The <hi>Iſraelite</hi> was tyed up very ſtrait; he muſt keep this Feaſt, and he muſt keep it with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out leaven, and according to all its ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nances and conſtitutions. There was dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger
<pb n="191" facs="tcp:59207:104"/>if he did not keep it <hi>as he ſhould,</hi> and danger if he did not keep <hi>it at all:</hi> If he either keep it not, or kept it amiſs, he rendred himſelf liable to the curſe of the Law; and that none of the ſmaller neither, but he was liable to be <hi>cut off</hi> from among his people for it. And though I ſhall not now examine the different opinions about what is meant by that expreſſion of being <hi>cut off from their people;</hi> yet <hi>I</hi> ſhall tell you that it does import a very great ſeverity: And therefore we find it annexed to ſuch ſins as the Law of <hi>Moſes</hi> allowed no ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piation for. There was no Sacrifice ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted to make atonement for that offence to which this <hi>exciſion</hi> did belong. The ſin of ignorance might be expiated by a Sacrifice, but there was no atoning ſuch a ſin as hath this penalty annexed to it. The Soul that ſinned <hi>preſumptuouſly</hi> was to be <hi>cut off from among his people:</hi> Numb. 15. 28, 30. Such a man was reſerved to the puniſhment of God, though he were ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>empt from the ſword of the Magiſtrate. It is ſaid of him that would not obey the Meſſiah that God <hi>will require it of him,</hi> Deut. 18.17. But when St. <hi>Peter</hi> cites this paſſage he expreſſeth it in other words; <hi>viz.</hi> that ſuch a man ſhall <hi>be deſtroyed from among the people,</hi> Act. 3.23. Or cut off
<pb n="192" facs="tcp:59207:105"/>from the people, for he uſes the ſame <hi>Greek</hi> word by which this <hi>cutting off</hi> is expreſſed by the <hi>Septuagint,</hi> Numb. 15.30. By which it appears to be a very hainous offence which is thus denounced againſt, and an offence of that nature that God reſerves the puniſhment of it to himſelf, and which he allowed no expiation for under the Law of <hi>Moſes.</hi> Thus it was with the Paſſover. Every <hi>Jew</hi> was bound to keep it, or elſe muſt be liable for his neglect to the greateſt curſe. And this curſe was unavoidable too, for God took upon himſelf the execution of it, who would not let him eſcape that might other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe have avoided the ſeverity of the Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giſtrate.</p>
               <p>Can we then imagine that we ſhall eſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cape, if we neglect to eat of this Bread, and drink of this Cup? Let us not de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive ourſelves, we ſhall not eſcape: God will require it of us. Certainly, the Paſſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>over was in remembrance of their Delive<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance from <hi>Egypt,</hi> but our Sacrament is in remembrance of a greater deliverance by the death of Jeſus, who was our Paſſover that was ſacrificed for us. If they did not eſcape, how ſhall we eſcape? We may in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed eſcape the Magiſtrates ſword, but not Gods anger. We may avoid the cen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſures
<pb n="193" facs="tcp:59207:105"/>of our Superiours, but we ſhall not avoid the wrath of the Almighty. We are greatly miſtaken if we think we may ſafely omit this duty, or that we take a ſecure courſe to avoid the danger of un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>worthy Communicating, when we chuſe not to Communicate at all: We do in ſo doing but run out of one danger into ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther. The <hi>Jew</hi> that kept the Paſſover, and eat leavened bread, was under the curſe of the Law; and ſo was he that did not keep the Feaſt at all: There is a great danger on either ſide; we run upon our ruin on which hand ſoever we err.</p>
               <p>Indeed the Apoſtle tells us the danger of our unworthy partaking of this Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment: He tells us that the unworthy Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>municant eats and drinks damnation to himſelf, and that for this cauſe many are weak and ſickly, and many ſleep, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 11.29, 30. This makes us afraid, and well indeed it may awaken us. But then we ſhould conſider alſo the danger of not partaking at all. This is that we are not much aware of: And perhaps one reaſon is, becauſe we do not find the Apoſtle tell us of the danger of not partaking at all, even when he does tell us the dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger of not receiving as we ought. But it is very eaſie to tell the reaſon why the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſtle
<pb n="194" facs="tcp:59207:106"/>does not ſpeak of that: And the reaſon is this, becauſe the firſt Chriſtians did not only eat of this bread, and drink of this cup, but they did it frequently al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſo. The <hi>Corinthians</hi> did Communicate, but they did it not as they ought: This the Apoſtle had a fair occaſion to reprove them for, and he does it, and alſo ſhews them the danger of what they did. They did not as we do, wholly neglect to par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>take of the Sacrament, but they were too negligent in their Preparation for it, too careleſs and remiſs in ſo holy and ſolemn a ſervice. The firſt Chriſtians Communi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cated frequently, they did not ſo eaſily forget the Precept, and the dear Love of their dying Lord, as we do. But then ſo it was that what was ſo frequently done, was not done ſo devoutly as it ſhould have been; and the Lords-Table was eſteem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed too common, and they did not eat of that Bread, and drink of that Cup, with that difference and diſcrimination, which well became ſo great a ſervice. This is a thing too incident to our frail nature, that we are too indevout in thoſe ſervices and offices of Religion, which do frequently entertain us. This was the fault of theſe <hi>Corinthians,</hi> they were not guilty of a neglect of the duty it ſelf,
<pb n="195" facs="tcp:59207:106"/>but did not perform it as became them, and the excellent ſervice which they did perform.</p>

               <p>By what hath been ſaid it appears to be our duty and our intereſt alſo to par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>take of this Sacrament of the Lords Sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per; what it is that keeps us back it is not eaſie to ſay. Certain it is that the Law is not repealed, nor yet does the reaſon of it ceaſe. There is the ſame precept, and as great a reaſon to enforce it, and our needs are as great, and the danger of its neglect as great alſo as ever. And we are very weak if we do imagine that when he that does partake of this Sacrament amiſs, makes himſelf obnoxious to Gods wrath, he ſhall eſcape that does not partake at all: But yet becauſe we are very apt to make ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuſes when we are invited to this Feaſt, and pleaſe our ſelves too that we do it juſtly, I ſhall ſeverally conſider thoſe com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon and popular pretences which we make uſe of in this caſe. And,</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Object.</hi> 1. Firſt, ſome men ſay, when they are invited, that they are not worthy.
<pb n="196" facs="tcp:59207:107"/>And this is thought a juſt excuſe becauſe the Apoſtle tells us, <hi>that he that eateth and drinketh unworthily, eateth and drinketh damnation to himſelf,</hi> 1 Cor. 11.29.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Anſw.</hi> In anſwer to this it is neceſſary we ſhould know what is meant by <hi>not be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing worthy,</hi> which is pretended here as an excuſe why we do not partake of this Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crament. <hi>If</hi> by it we mean that we do not <hi>deſerve</hi> to be entertained at Gods Ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble, what we ſay indeed is a great <hi>truth,</hi> but yet it is not <hi>pertinent,</hi> nor is it ſuch a worthineſs which is required of us. But if by not being worthy we mean that we are not <hi>fit</hi> and <hi>rightly</hi> prepared to partake of this holy Table of our Lord, then we may not indeed partake; but then this will not be a juſt excuſe, it will not clear us and abſolve us from our duty.</p>
               <p>Certain it is that that worthineſs which we muſt come with, does not imply our <hi>merit</hi> or <hi>deſert,</hi> but it only imports ſuch a <hi>fitneſs</hi> and <hi>preparation</hi> of Soul as is <hi>requi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red,</hi> and <hi>God</hi> will <hi>accept.</hi> For though in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed the word <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>, worthy does ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times import <hi>deſert</hi> or <hi>merit:</hi> Thus the labourer is worthy of his hire; <hi>i. e.</hi> he deſerves his wages; yet it does not al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wayes ſignifie ſo, nor yet in this caſe we are ſpeaking of. The word <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap> we tran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſlate
<pb n="197" facs="tcp:59207:107"/>
                  <hi>meet,</hi> 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 16.4.2 <hi>Theſ.</hi> 1.3. we are obliged to walk <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>, <hi>worthy of God,</hi> i. e. becoming our profeſſion of him, and the Mercies we receive from him, 1 <hi>Theſ.</hi> 2.12. And we muſt walk <hi>worthy</hi> of our <hi>vocation,</hi> Eph. 4.1. Aye, and <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap> worthy of the Goſpel, or <hi>as it becometh the Goſpel,</hi> as we well tranſlate it, <hi>Phil.</hi> 1.27. And he does re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive this Sacrament <hi>worthily,</hi> who does it as is required, and with a clean and pure heart.</p>
               <p>For otherwiſe this command of parta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king of this Sacrament were unpractica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble. If none might receive it but they who deſerved this Heavenly Food, we might not approach, who are unworthy of the common mercies which we do en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joy: Now it is a very great error to af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firm, that our Lord hath commanded us to do what is impoſſible to be done. And we have the leaſt reaſon to affirm it of this ſervice that it is not practicable. For cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainly this is one of the eaſier Precepts of the Goſpel. And though we ſhould think our Saviour required a very hard task of us, when he bids us <hi>deny our ſelves,</hi> and <hi>take up our Croſs,</hi> and <hi>follow him;</hi> yet we cannot think ſo when he only bids to <hi>do this in remembrance of him.</hi> This is a ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice
<pb n="198" facs="tcp:59207:108"/>of praiſe and thanksgiving, and ſuch ſervices are not burdenſome to thoſe who have not forfeited their gratitude and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>genuity. And did we love our deareſt Lord as we ſhould do, or as he loved us, we ſhould not think much of any thing that he ſhould require at our hands; much leſs ſhould we boggle at ſo eaſie and reaſonable a ſervice as this is. It was great folly in <hi>Naaman,</hi> that he refuſed to waſh and be clean, according to the advice which the man of God gave him. And his ſervants ſpake wiſely to him when they ſaid, <hi>My father, if the Prophet had bid thee do ſome great thing, wouldeſt thou not have done it? How much rather then when he ſaith to thee, waſh and be clean?</hi> 2 King. 5.13. If there be any thing hard and dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficult which our Saviour hath commanded (for he tells us, <hi>that his yoke is eaſie, and his burden is light,</hi>) yet ſure I am this is not. So far is it from being impoſſible, that it is indeed not difficult to him that is a ſincere and diligent Diſciple of our Lord and Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viour.</p>
               <p>What hath been ſaid makes it evident. that that worthineſs which is required in the Communicant does not imply <hi>merit</hi> or <hi>deſert,</hi> but only ſuch a <hi>fitneſs,</hi> and <hi>ſincere</hi> and <hi>holy diſpoſition</hi> of Soul, as God does
<pb n="199" facs="tcp:59207:108"/>require and will accept. And we may be worthy partakers of this Table when we are very ſenſible of our own demerits. And indeed to think meanly of our ſelves, does very much diſpoſe us to receive the benefits of this Sacrament. And there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore when we ſay we are not worthy, and make this excuſe, our meaning muſt be, that we are not fit and prepared for this Holy Table. Now if this be all we have to ſay, that we are not <hi>fit,</hi> and <hi>prepared,</hi> and therefore we do not approach to this Table, we ſhall find that this is no juſt ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuſe.</p>
               <p>For if it were, we might with the ſame caſe excuſe our ſelves from the practice of the other Laws of Chriſt. Whereas we are commanded to give to the poor, we might by the ſame reaſon excuſe our obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience, and ſay, that we cannot do that, becauſe we are not charitable; and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſides that, we cannot give alms as we ought, becauſe we are proud, and love to be ſeen of men, and to receive their praiſe, and therefore rather than do it amiſs we will not do it all. Thus may we excuſe our ſelves from works of mercy, from acts of piety, and the ſervices of Religion. We may by this method excuſe our ſelves from ſerving God, and doing good to our
<pb n="200" facs="tcp:59207:109"/>Neighbour. We are not willing our ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vants ſhould do by us as we do by God. We expect they ſhould do as we bid them, nor ſhall it ſerve their turns to ſay that they are not <hi>diſpoſed</hi> to do what we command. We juſtly look that they be ready to obey us, and that they do not indulge them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves in their ſloth, and contumacy. We may be aſhamed to ſerve God at that rate which we ſhould not accept from our ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vants. The <hi>Jew</hi> might eaſily have avoid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed the Paſſover, if this ſlender excuſe would have ſerved his turn. But God commands him to keep it, and he muſt take care to do it as he ought. If he fail in either of them, he is liable to be cut off from among his people. There was no ſuch excuſe to be admitted.</p>
               <p>Again, when you ſay you are not fit, let me ask you whether or no you have done all you poſſibly can to fit your ſelves. I wiſh you would put this queſtion home to your Conſciences, and deal ſincerely in it. Have you laboured greatly to fit your ſelves? have you to that purpoſe ſet aſide ſome time in order to the examining of your Conſciences? Have you earneſtly prayed to God for his aid and aſſiſtance? Have you done it frequently? Have you advi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed with your ſpiritual guides about this
<pb n="201" facs="tcp:59207:109"/>weighty matter? Have you uſed as great a care as men are wont to uſe in clearing their title to their Eſtates and worldly Poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeſſions? Do you do as much for your Souls, as you do for your Bodies and E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtates? You are not fit to receive the Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crament you ſay; but have you laboured greatly that you might be fit? Have you done all you can poſſibly do: And after all this, is it the grief of your heart that you are not fit? and do you continue to la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour that ye may? Conſider whether it be thus or no with you. Do not dare to mock God, nor think that you ſhall be able to deceive him. Have a care how you diſſemble with the God of Heaven and Earth. If you are not fit, nor yet ſtriving to become ſo, you are indeed in a very miſerable condition. He that com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mands you to partake of this Table, com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mands you to be fit to do it alſo. We are not only required to eat of this Bread, and drink of this Cup, but in or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der to that, to examine our ſelves. If we neglect to fit our ſelves, that will not excuſe us from neglecting the receiving of this Sacrament, unleſs we think one fault will excuſe another.</p>
               <p>Again, we ſhall do well to conſider what it is that renders us unfit. Have we
<pb n="202" facs="tcp:59207:110"/>not ſome ſecret ſin which we are not wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling to part with? We know the danger to be great, if we bring with us a love to our ſins; then indeed we eat and drink our own Death. Let us then caſt our eyes inward, and ſee what that ſin is which we are ſo fond of. I doubt not but men may many times eaſily find where the true reaſon lies which renders them un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fit. Perhaps we are not willing to for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>give our Enemy, or elſe we are not rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy to make reſtitution to our neighbour whom we have injured; or we live a prophane and ungodly life, and are not reconciled to the ways of piety and holi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs. It may be that we are not willing to part with our ſenſual and worldly luſts, and we are afraid of being too ſeverely and ſtrictly bound up to a life of Religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on and Mortification: This is much to be ſuſpected; for certainly if we loved our Religion; and hated our ſins, we ſhould be very glad of any opportunity that would engage us more ſtrictly to do well, and to depart from evil. Sure I am that to him that is truly good, and labours ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerely to be better, the tydings of this Sacrament is welcome news: He does gladly embrace this bleſſed opportunity of becoming good. For the truth of what I
<pb n="203" facs="tcp:59207:110"/>ſay I dare appeal to the Conſcience of de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vout and religious perſons. And therefore it is much to be feared that the cauſe which makes us unfit is this, becauſe we love our ſins more than we love our God. And if it be thus I would wiſh ſuch peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple to conſider,</p>
               <p>How unfit they are to dye. For in this caſe that which makes them unfit to receive this Sacrament renders them unfit to dye alſo. Now his condition is very diſmally dangerous who dares to live in that ſtate of things in which he would be afraid to dye. We may indeed refuſe to Commu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nicate when we have an opportunity of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fered us, but we ſhall not be able to put by the ſtroke of death. When God calls us out of this World (and how ſoon we may be called we cannot tell) we muſt go not only whether we be <hi>willing</hi> but alſo whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther we be <hi>fit</hi> to go out or not, we ſhall not find that any of our excuſes will be then taken. And methinks we ſhould be perſwaded to fit our ſelves for death, it being ſo much our intereſt to be prepared for it. And though we cannot be per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwaded to <hi>receive the Sacrament,</hi> yet ſure we cannot but judge it our duty, and our intereſt alſo, to make our ſelves <hi>fit</hi> for it. He that is fit to dye is fit to receive alſo,
<pb n="204" facs="tcp:59207:111"/>and who would not labour hard to be fit to die, that knows his time here cannot be long, but may be exceeding ſhort: Be not then ſo cruel to your own ſouls as to be unprepared for death; this makes you liable to not only a great ſorrow but an everlaſting ſorrow alſo.</p>
               <p>Before I leave this matter, I would know of him, that makes this excuſe <hi>that he is not fit,</hi> whether he ſpeak as he think. Do you really judge your ſelves unfit? For it is poſſible that a man may make this ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuſe, and yet have a great opinion of him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf, and judge better of himſelf than other men, who do receive this Sacrament, and do it as they ſhould. And therefore let me put it to thy Conſcience, doſt thou really judg thy ſelf to be unfit? If thou doeſt, then tell me what effect this hath upon thee? Art thou greatly humbled under this con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition? Doſt thou ſtrive whatever thou canſt to prepare thy ſelf? Is it that which you greatly labour for? Are you willing to take as much pains in the caſe as you do for your bodies or eſtates? If you do not ſtrive to become better, when do you think you ſhall be fit? Put theſe things home to your Conſciences: And I doubt not but that if you be ſincere and do not diſſem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
<pb n="205" facs="tcp:59207:111"/>with God, you may be fitted and pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pared for this ſervice.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Object.</hi> 2. Secondly, there are others excuſe themſelves from this ſervice upon a prudential account, as they eſteem it. And thus it is; they underſtand by the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtle, that they eat and drink damnation to themſelves if they do it <hi>unworthily,</hi> and therefore they conclude it the ſafer courſe not to receive it at all. By this means they think they avoid the danger of unworthy receiving, and take the moſt ſecure courſe in not receiving at all. This I fear is the ground that too many reſt upon who do forbear to eat of this Bread and drink of this Cup.</p>
               <p>In anſwer to this pretence I ſhall not need to ſay much, eſpecially if what hath been ſaid before be duly conſidered: But yet ſomething I ſhall ſay to it: And,</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Anſw.</hi> Firſt, I muſt tell you that though this may be thought a ſafe and prudential courſe, yet it is far from being ſo. For what prudence is it to run from one ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tream to another, and to neglect the mean which we ought to aim at? We ſhall not need to forbear, nor yet to receive un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>worthily: Why do we not prepare our ſelves and receive as we ought! Shall we call it a prudential courſe to run away from the
<pb n="206" facs="tcp:59207:112"/>Laws of Chriſt? Or ſhall he be thought a wiſe man that runs from one danger into another that is as great? <hi>This is as if a Man ſhould flee from a Lion, and a Bear ſhould meet him, or a Serpent bite him,</hi> that I may uſe the words of the Prophet, <hi>Amos</hi> 5.19. 'Tis like the prudence of the ſinner in other things: He is apt to run into extreams: Thus he does frequent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly do. When he ſhould poſſeſs himſelf of a well-grounded <hi>hope,</hi> he either <hi>pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſumes,</hi> or elſe <hi>deſpairs;</hi> when he ſhould be <hi>patient,</hi> he is <hi>ſtupid</hi> and <hi>ſenſeleſs,</hi> or elſe he is <hi>querulous</hi> and <hi>murmuring:</hi> When he ſhould do good with his riches, and <hi>re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve</hi> the <hi>poor,</hi> he either <hi>profuſely ſpends</hi> them upon his luſts, or elſe is <hi>penurious</hi> and <hi>covetous.</hi> And when he ſhould <hi>hear</hi> the <hi>word</hi> of <hi>God</hi> and <hi>keep it;</hi> he either will <hi>not hear</hi> it, or will <hi>not keep</hi> it. And as he ſhews great folly in all theſe things ſo he does in the caſe before us; For whereas he is required to <hi>receive</hi> this Sacrament <hi>worthily,</hi> he inſtead of that either <hi>receives</hi> it <hi>amiſs,</hi> or elſe will <hi>not receive at all.</hi> Which is ſo far from being prudently done that it is indeed an argument of great folly; and he that takes ſuch a courſe is far from being <hi>ſafe:</hi> He that does thus, runs indeed from a great miſchief, but he runs
<pb n="207" facs="tcp:59207:112"/>into another. There is a rock on each hand that he may ſplit upon; he dies if he eat unworthily, and ſo he does if he careleſly neglect to eat at all. <hi>He that eats and drinks unworthily eats and drinks dam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation to himſelf.</hi> There's death there; but then we are told by truth it ſelf, <hi>Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cept ye eat the fleſh of the ſon of man, and drink his blood ye have no life in you,</hi> Joh. 6.53. There's a death that meets us alſo. We may meet with death from a <hi>ſurfeit,</hi> and ſo we may from a <hi>famine,</hi> and <hi>too long</hi> an <hi>abſtinence.</hi> He were a very ridiculous man who becauſe he is forbidden meat by his Phyſician in a Paroxyſm of his Fever, or under the operation of a Purgative Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicine ſhould thereupon reſolve to eat no more. By this means he will not only ſtarve his diſeaſe, but ſtarve himſelf alſo.</p>
               <p>Beſides, at this rate we might avoid the other precepts of Religion as well as this. The <hi>Jew</hi> might have eluded Gods com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mands that obliged him to obedience un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der this pretext that he feared he ſhould not do what God required aright. There is danger in hearing Gods Word careleſly, ſhall we therefore chuſe not to hear it all? We may diſpleaſe God in our prayers, if we pray not as we ſhould, ſhall we there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
<pb n="208" facs="tcp:59207:113"/>fore not pray at all? We may give alms amiſs; ſhall we therefore ſhut our bowels upon the poor? We may keep a faſt for evil ends, ſhall we therefore keep none at all? There are ſome that come to Church and do it from an ill principle, and do thereby increaſe their condemnation, ſhall we therefore ſtay at home? Some preach Chriſt out of ill will, ſhall I not there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore preach any more? Sure, whatever we may judg, here is little prudence ſhewn.</p>
               <p>For all this while it ought to be conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered, that we do not contract our guilt by receiving but by receiving unworthily. And therefore if we ſhewed our ſelves wiſe we ſhould do it by making our ſelves fit for this ſervice, and not by forbearing it altogether. If we took this courſe we ſhould avoid all the danger, and not only that, but greatly advantage our own Souls: Whereas now we run our ſelves up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on a great curfe. If we come, and are un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fit, we are accurſed; and ſo we are if we do not come at all: I ſhall end that which I had to ſay to this pretence with the words of a late Writer,<note place="margin">Mr. <hi>Daniel Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gers</hi> Treat. of the Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments <hi>part.</hi> 2. <hi>pag.</hi> 211.</note> who was well known, not long ſince, in theſe parts. And his words upon this occaſion are theſe. <q>If ſcanty coming be a ſin,
<pb n="209" facs="tcp:59207:113"/>what a fearful premunire then run they into, that refuſe at all to come? <hi>And preſently afterwards he denounces</hi> terror to all profane <hi>Eſau</hi>'s <hi>(as he calls them)</hi> who being out of love with the Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment through loathing of examination of their woful profane lives make it their conſtant practice to abandon all Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments. And when they are cut off by mens cenſures for this their contempt, they are content ſo to live, and are no whit troubled; a man knows not whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther the diſeaſe or remedy do worſe with them; I might compare them to <hi>Cain,</hi> ſave that I ſhould wrong him by ſo unjuſt a compariſon: <hi>Cain</hi> becauſe he had villainouſly and ſacrilegiouſly defiled the Ordinances which <hi>Abel</hi> and he joined in, was debarred of them, and for ever caſt out of Gods preſence: But as curſed as he was he could lay it to heart, and ſay it was too great for me to bear. But theſe Atheiſts and Swine are ſo far from that, that they wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lingly content themſelves to be caſt out, and think it a good bar to keep them from that, which they are glad to be rid of. If ye ask why they do thus, they ſay they have buſineſs to do, and cannot skill of this new doctrine of trial,
<pb n="210" facs="tcp:59207:114"/>or cannot be reconciled with their ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies: But oh monſters in the ſhape of men!—Surely ye ſhall pay double for your contempt, both of the means and the duty it ſelf.—Oh! But if they come not they ſhall not eat (ſay they) and drink their own damnation! <hi>Anſw.</hi> Yet they eſcape not; let them tell me whether of theſe ſentences be more eaſie, <hi>viz.</hi> They eat and drink their own condemnation by coming; Or, take him and bind him, caſt him into utter darkneſs, where there is wail<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, weeping and gnaſhing of teeth for not coming? If there be any odds much good do them with it: But their deep Logick cannot help them to any.</q>
                  <hi>Thus he.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>And thus much in anſwer to this pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tence: I now proceed.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Object.</hi> 3. Thirdly there are others who perhaps are afraid of Communica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting with profane and wicked men. And this is that which keeps them back. They ſay they dare not Communicate with the wicked.</p>
               <p>It is ſuppoſed that they who make this pretence do not make the former. For it might ſeem very ſtrange that the ſame man
<pb n="211" facs="tcp:59207:114"/>ſhould uſe both this and the other alſo; that he ſhould at one time pretend he dares not Communicate becauſe he is not fit to do it; and at another time pretend that he dares not do it becauſe he looks upon other men to be unfit to receive with him. For by the firſt he would ſeem to inſinuate that he hath a very mean opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion of himſelf, and by this that he thinks very well of himſelf, how ill ſoever he judges of his brother. Having premiſed this I anſwer,</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Anſw.</hi> Firſt, that we ought to be very careful that we be not too cenſorious; that we do not too boldly take upon our ſelves the office of a Judge which belongs not to us. Let us have a care that we be not too raſh.</p>
               <p>Secondly, ſuppoſe it as it is pretended; yet is there no reaſon we ſhould ſuffer for another man's fault. Will not you do your duty becauſe another man neglects his? You may not come unleſs you be fit, and will you not come till your brother be fit too? Shall another mans fault diſcharge you from your duty? Chriſt commands thee to do this; thy duty is plain and determined: He did not put in this exception, and how then do you dare to do it? Another mans neglect will not be charged upon thy
<pb n="212" facs="tcp:59207:115"/>ſcore. It is a very unreaſonable pretence that you muſt not come till you are ſatis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied that other men are fit as well as you. Thy own ſins muſt keep thee back, but muſt another mans do ſo too? It would be very ſtrange that when you are fit it ſhould be then in the power of another man to render you unfit. The Apoſtle ſays, let a man <hi>examine himſelf, and ſo let him eat;</hi> but he no where puts this in that we muſt examine others alſo. You would have an hard task of it indeed, if you might not proceed till you were ſatisfied in other men as well as in your ſelves. You are never like to Communicate if this be a ſufficient objection. Have a care you do not think Chriſt hath commanded you that which is unpracticable. We know not when we may Communicate if we may not do it till others are prepared as well as we. 'Tis very unreaſonable to think that we ſhall be thus eaſily excuſed.</p>
               <p>Thirdly, We may by no means ſeparate from our brother till he have been admo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhed and reproved, and he be found in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>corrigible, <hi>Matth.</hi> 18.15. Our Saviour hath taught us our duty in this plainly. Haſt thou reproved thy brother for his of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fence as Chriſt does direct? How knoweſt thou but that thou mayeſt by that means
<pb n="213" facs="tcp:59207:115"/>gain him? Thou mayeſt not ſeparate from him till he appear to be incorrigible, and then indeed when the Church hath caſt him out thou art to with-draw. But then ſtill it belongs not to every private Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtian to exclude an offender from the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munion. It is no part of our duty, nor are we by any means fit for it. We ſhould be too forward to uſe this power amiſs, and not to go that Chriſtian way which our Saviour does oblige us to, <hi>Matth.</hi> 18. We know that among the <hi>Corinthians</hi> there were evil men that were <hi>carnal,</hi> 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 3.3. others that were <hi>injurious</hi> and that <hi>went to Law</hi> with one another before infidels, <hi>Chap.</hi> 6. There was fornication and inceſt among them, <hi>chap.</hi> 5.1. And thoſe there were that did behave themſelves unchriſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>anly at the <hi>Lords Table,</hi> chap. 11. Yet we find not that the cenſure of Excommu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation is ſent out againſt any but the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſtuous: From whence it is eaſie to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clude that to Communicate with ſuch is not unlawful in a Chriſtian Church. To which I may add that when the Apoſtle reproves them for their unworthy receiv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing this Sacrament, it is their own proper negligence he reproves, and not their joyning together in the ſervice.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="214" facs="tcp:59207:116"/>Fourthly, our communicating with an evil man does not make us partakers of his ſin. For that which we communicate with him in is the profeſſion of Chriſtiani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, and the ſervice of God. And certain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly I may joyn in the profeſſion of my Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion with him who is no more than a bare profeſſor. This is not to joyn with him in his ſin, but indeed in doing my duty to Almighty God. Sin is not caught as in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fectious diſeaſes are by ſtanding near one another; we then are infected by an evil man when we imitate his bad example. It is very evident that <hi>Judas</hi> received this Sacrament among the other Diſciples, our Saviour did not ſend him away (and yet he knew his wickedneſs) leſt he ſhould infect the other Diſciples. We are requi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red to have no fellowſhip with the <hi>unfruit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful works of darkneſs,</hi> Eph. 5.11. The <hi>ſin</hi> we muſt avoid and reprove, but we cannot always avoid the <hi>ſinner.</hi> I confeſs we ought as much as we can to avoid the evil doer; we ought not to chuſe his com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pany unleſs it be out of a deſign to reclaim him, and bring him back; this will well become us to endeavour. And where we cannot avoid the ſinner we may ſhun his evil works, and by declaring againſt his
<pb n="215" facs="tcp:59207:116"/>ſin, we may take off the ſuſpicion of our approving his evil ways.</p>
               <p>What I have ſaid hitherto muſt not be ſo underſtood as if I would encourage thoſe men to Communicate who are not fit to do it. I have not ſaid any thing which can be reaſonably judged to import any ſuch thing. He that is not fit will eat and drink damnation to himſelf. And therefore every man is obliged very ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verely to examine his own Conſcience. But yet certain it is that there may be thoſe who are unfit, whom yet I cannot by any law of God or man exclude from it. And as certain it is that we may very lawfully communicate with thoſe who are yet ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry unfit to communicate themſelves. And when the Apoſtle (1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 11.) blames thoſe who did not Communicate as they ſhould do, yet he does not blame either thoſe who miniſtred to them, or thoſe that did Communicate with them. And therefore thoſe that do receive this Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment ought to be very ſevere in the exa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mination of themſelves. They may be ſuch whom we cannot lawfully exclude, nor yet can you lawfully ſeparate from them, and yet not be ſuch as God will ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cept.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="216" facs="tcp:59207:117"/>And therefore ſuch men ought not to think themſelves fit becauſe the Miniſters of Souls cannot exclude them as unfit, and becauſe the beſt Chriſtians cannot lawful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly withdraw from them. For it is very certain that there are many things may render us unfit to Communicate, which yet do not make us liable to the cenſures of the Church. Though we may not juſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly be rejected as Criminals, yet we may for all that be ſuch in the eyes of God. And therefore it will well become every one of us to ſet about the examining our Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſciences with fear and trembling: Let us not think our condition good becauſe the Church does not exclude us from theſe holy Myſteries. We may be very evil men, and yet not be liable to the cenſure of the pureſt Church. But it will become us to judg our ſelves where our Superiors do not, and indeed cannot judg us. We ſhall do well to erect a tribunal in our own breaſt, and to condemn our ſelves for thoſe follies and impieties which other men cannot condemn us for. And there being now among us at once ſo great a de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cay both of <hi>piety</hi> and <hi>diſcipline</hi> alſo, the beſt advice that can be given in the caſe is that we would take ſevere accounts of our ſelves, and conduct our repentance by the
<pb n="217" facs="tcp:59207:117"/>continual advices and miniſtery of a Spiri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tual guide. <q>For by this alone, or prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipally (as a very excellent perſon tells us) was the Primitive piety and repen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tances advanced to the excellency which we often admire but ſeldom imitate; and the event will be, that, beſides we ſhall be guided in the ways of holineſs in general, we ſhall be at peace as to the times and manner of receiving the holy Sacrament.<seg rend="decorInit">—</seg>And we ſhall not ſo fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently feel the effects of the Divine an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger upon our perſons as a reproach of our folly, &amp; thepuniſhment of ourunwor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thy receiving the divine Myſteries. And this (ſays he) was earneſtly adviſed and preſſed upon their people by the holy Fathers, who had as great experience in their conduct, as they had zeal for the good of Souls.</q>
               </p>
               <p>Fourthly, there are others who do grant it to be their duty to receive, but yet not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withſtanding refuſe to do it; and that be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe they may not be admitted to do it after ſuch a manner as they would, and as they think they ought to do it. And perhaps theſe men do particularly except againſt kneeling when they do receive it, and becauſe this is required by the Law, and they account it a ſin to yield obedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence
<pb n="218" facs="tcp:59207:118"/>to it, therefore they refuſe to receive at all. Now I ſhall particularly conſider thoſe Objections which are or may be brought againſt kneeling: And,</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Obj.</hi> Firſt, it may be objected that kneel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing is not agreeable to our Saviours exam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple when he did inſtitute this Bleſſed Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crament, and therefore it is unlawful. The Diſciples of our Lord did not receive it kneeling, and therefore we may not.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Anſw.</hi> In anſwer to this I ſhall not put the Objector upon proving either what the poſture was, or that it was not that of kneeling, in which the Diſciples did re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive this Sacrament with our Lord, but I will ſuppoſe that they did not kneel, but that they uſed that geſture which was commonly uſed at their meals; that is, that they did lie along upon beds, which is ſaid to be the geſture uſed at meals in thoſe times, and in that place; yet I ſhall ſhew notwithſtanding this that we may not refuſe to receive the Sacrament upon our knees. For,</p>
               <p n="1">1. It is not to be thought that we are more obliged to follow the example of Chriſt and his Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtles in their <hi>geſture</hi> (which is but a circumſtance of an acti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on) than we are in the other
<pb n="219" facs="tcp:59207:118"/>circumſtances of <hi>time,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Vid. <hi>Dr.</hi> San<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſon <hi>de obligat.

Our Saviour gave the Sacrament in a <hi>private houſe,</hi> and in an <hi>upper room:</hi> He gave it alſo in the <hi>Evening</hi> and after <hi>Supper;</hi> and when he gave it he gave it in a <hi>Coat without a ſeam,</hi> yet for all this theſe men that make this objection do not in theſe things follow the example of Chriſt, nor yet require other men to do it: I know no reaſon can be given why we are not as much obliged to one cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumſtance as another. 'Tis not certainly to be believed that we ſhould be only obli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged to the poſture, and not alſo to the time and place. If we muſt do it in the ſame geſture, why do we not alſo do it at the ſame time and place? And if we uſe our liberty in the time and place it is ſtrange we ſhould make ſo great a ſtir a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout the geſture.</p>
               <p n="2">2. It is very certain that if our Saviour and his Diſciples did lie along upon Beds when this Sacrament was inſtituted, that who ever does ſit or ſtand when he re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceives the Sacrament does deviate from
<pb n="220" facs="tcp:59207:119"/>Chriſts example as well as he that kneels. For none of theſe are the geſture which our Saviour and his Diſciples are ſuppo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed to have uſed. And if on behalf of ſitting it be pleaded that that being our Table-geſture, ought to ſucceed to that which our Saviour uſed. I anſwer,
<list>
                     <item>(1.) That we are not by any law of Chriſt forbid to receive the Sacrament un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs we can receive it in ſuch a geſture as is commonly uſed by men at their Tables; nor have we any ſuch command that does oblige us to uſe any certain ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſture.</item>
                     <item>(2.) That then it muſt be granted that if it had been the cuſtom to eat our meals upon our knees it would have been very lawful for us to have kneeled at the receiv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the Sacrament. From whence it will follow that it is not evil in it ſelf to do it and ſo far from that that it would have been our duty had it but happened to have been the cuſtom of the Country to have eaten our meat upon our knees. And then,</item>
                     <item>(3.) It will be very ſtrange that the Lawes of our juſt Superiors ſhould not have as great an influence upon us as the caſual cuſtoms of the place where welive;
<pb n="221" facs="tcp:59207:119"/>eſpecially when we are ſo often called up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on to obey our Superiors, and required to <hi>obey every ordinance of man for the Lords ſake.</hi> We have very plain Scripture that commands us to obey the King, and all in Authority. But we have none at all that forbids us to kneel, or commands us to ſit when we receive the Sacrament. And our being determined to our Table-geſture is not from any Law of Chriſt.</item>
                     <item>(4.) It will alſo follow from hence that it will be unlawful to <hi>ſtand</hi> as well as to <hi>kneel,</hi> neither of them being agreeable to the example of our Saviour, nay, nor the geſtures which are commonly uſed when we eat at our Tables. Nay,</item>
                     <item>(5.) After this manner of reaſoning we ſhould ſin if we ſhould receive the Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment lying along as the Diſciples are ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed to have done, becauſe it is not our Table-poſture; and ſo we ſhould contract a guilt when we did moſt cloſely follow the example of our Bleſſed Saviour.</item>
                  </list>
               </p>
               <p n="3">3. To what hath been ſaid this may be added, that the <hi>Jews</hi> were obliged to keep the Paſſover, and to keep it according as God had appointed; and we know that the Law of <hi>Moſes</hi> is very particular and preciſe in ſetting down the manner how God would be ſerved. And it does de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcend
<pb n="222" facs="tcp:59207:120"/>to very minute matters, and pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcribe how the ſervice muſt be performed. And thus it was in the Paſſover; they were determined to the <hi>time,</hi> and <hi>place,</hi> when and where this ſervice muſt be ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lemnized, and its particular rites are ſet down by <hi>Moſes.</hi> But yet notwithſtand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing all this, the geſture in which they were to eat this Paſſover is not expreſſed by <hi>Moſes;</hi> he is ſilent in this particular, and though he lets them know that they muſt keep the Paſſover, yet he does not tell them whether they muſt eat their Paſchal Lamb, ſitting or ſtanding, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> Now in this caſe the <hi>Jew</hi> was undetermined by any part of <hi>Moſes</hi> Law, as much as we are in the matter of the Sacrament, what ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſture we ſhall receive it in, by the Laws of Chriſt. Indeed if the example of thoſe who kept the firſt Paſſover might determine them,<note place="margin">
                     <hi>Vid.</hi> Bochart. De Animal. Scriptur. in Synopſ. <hi>Crit.</hi>
                  </note> they muſt eat it as they did: And it is thought moſt probable that they did eat it <hi>ſtanding.</hi> For they were expreſly required to eat it with their <hi>loyns girded,</hi> their <hi>ſhoos on their feet,</hi> and their <hi>ſtaff in their hand:</hi> And to <hi>eat it in hast, Exod.</hi> 12.11. But yet however we find not that the <hi>Jews</hi> obſerved any ſuch poſture afterwards, nor did they think
<pb n="223" facs="tcp:59207:120"/>themſelves obliged to imitate the example of thoſe who kept the firſt Paſſover. And our Saviour himſelf (who did obſerve the Law of <hi>Moſes</hi>) keeps the Paſſover indeed with his Diſciples, but not ſtanding, but ſitting, or lying along; which was a po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſture that was not injoyned the <hi>Iſraelites</hi> by the Law of <hi>Moſes,</hi> nor yet warranted by the example of the firſt eaters of the Paſſover, however it were introduced by the general conſent of the Nation, or the command of their Superiors. For there being no Law in the caſe given by <hi>Moſes,</hi> they did not think themſelves obliged to imitate the example of thoſe who in <hi>Egypt</hi> eat the Paſſover, but did rather chuſe to comply with the cuſtom of their Country, or Law of their Superiors in this matter, it being not repugnant to any Law of God given by <hi>Moſes.</hi> And therefore the <hi>Jews</hi> do frequently tell us of ſundry things wherein the <gap reason="foreign">

Nay, beſides what hath been ſaid, we find that the <hi>Jews</hi> had their <gap reason="foreign">

               <p>And therefore certainly we have no rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon to doubt but that we may lawfully receive the Sacrament of the Lords Sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per upon our knees: It being not againſt any Law of Chriſt; and it is the Law of Chriſt, which in this caſe muſt determine us: If we be not determined by his Law we are left free, and therefore may very lawfully uſe this geſture. But then when our juſt Superior commands us, we are bound to obey even by the Laws of Chriſt,
<pb n="225" facs="tcp:59207:121"/>which oblige us to be ſubject to the higher powers. When we kneel at the receiv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing this Sacrament, we do nothing contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry to Chriſts Law: But if we refuſe to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive at all, becauſe we will not kneel, then it is moſt certain that we break the Laws of Chriſt, and that very greatly al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſo; both as we refuſe to <hi>do this</hi> as he commands us, and as we diſobey our juſt Superiors whom God hath ſet over us.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Object.</hi> But others perhaps will except againſt Kneeling, as that which will in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>volve us in Idolatry, it being ſuppoſed that when we kneel at our receiving the Sacrament, we do thereby worſhip the Bread and Wine, or at leaſt by them, as by an Image we worſhip Chriſt.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Anſ.</hi> 1. Whether by Kneeling when we receive the Sacrament, we may juſtly be thought to pay Religious Worſhip to the Creatures of Bread and Wine, will beſt be known by conſidering the intenti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of thoſe that do require Kneeling at our hands. Now it is very certain that our Church which requires we ſhould kneel, does openly diſallow that Doctrine of the Church of <hi>Rome,</hi> which puts them upon adoration of the outward Elements. And therefore whatever the Church of <hi>Rome</hi> is guilty of, yet it is certain that we
<pb n="226" facs="tcp:59207:122"/>believe the Bread and Wine to be Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures, and not in their nature altered, nor changed in ſubſtance from what they were. And conſequently it cannot be imagined that our Church ſhould require Kneeling, with an intention that we ſhould worſhip the Elements of Bread and Wine, when ſhe hath always taught a Doctrine that does contradict any ſuch practice. And this might ſuffice in anſwer to this Objection. But yet I add,</p>
               <p n="2">2. That this might be put out of all doubt, the Church of <hi>England</hi> hath far<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther declared her meaning in this matter: So that hereafter whoever ſhall charge her as guilty of Idolatry in requiring Kneel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing at the Sacrament, as if thereby ſhe in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended we ſhould adore the Bread and Wine, will ſhew himſelf either <hi>profoundly ignorant;</hi> or <hi>greatly malicious.</hi> What our Church declares to this purpoſe may be found in the Book of Common-Prayer, at the end of the Rubrick, after the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munion-Service, in theſe words: <hi>Whereas it is ordained in this Office for the Admini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stration of the Lords Supper, that the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>municants ſhould receive the ſame Kneeling; (which order is well meant for a ſignification of our humble and grateful acknowledgment of the benefits of Chriſt, therein given to all
<pb n="227" facs="tcp:59207:122"/>worthy Receivers, and for the avoiding of ſuch profanation, and diſorder in the. Holy Communion, as might otherwiſe enſue) yet, lest the ſame Kneeling ſhould by any perſons, either out of ignorance and infirmity, or out of malice and obſtinacy be miſconſtrued and depraved; It is here declared, that thereby no Adoration is intended, or ought to be done, either unto the Sacramental Bread and Wine, there bodily received, or unto any Cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poral preſence of Chriſts natural Fleſh and Blood. For the Sacramental Bread and Wine remain ſtill in their very natural ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stances, and therefore may not be adored, (for that were Idolatry to be abhorred of all faithful Chriſtians) and the natural Body and Blood of our Saviour Christ are in Heaven, and not here: It being againſt the truth of Chriſts natural body to be at one time in more places than one.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Thus plainly are we taught the Chur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches ſenſe in the caſe before us: Nor may we now imagine that by our Kneeling we are obliged to worſhip the Creature in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtead of the Creator.</p>
               <p n="3">3. The Sacrament is delivered to us with a Prayer, and certainly it is not only law<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful to Kneel when we pray, but it is alſo very agreeable to the example of our Bleſſed Saviour, <hi>Luk.</hi> 22.41. And if we
<pb n="228" facs="tcp:59207:123"/>are bound to pray alwayes, I am ſure it well becomes us to do it then. And there cannot poſſibly be any danger of Idolatry in bowing our Knees to the God and Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther of our Lord Jeſus Chriſt. If we may lawfully pray at all times, and in all pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces, we may very lawfully Kneel when we do it. And ſure no man in his wits can deny, but I may lawfully pray to God in the very act of receiving the Sacrament; and if I may do that, it is very evident that I may uſe that geſture which our Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viour did, when he prayed a little before his Agony and Death.</p>
               <p>What hath been ſaid I hope is enough to ſatisfie thoſe men who deſire to find the truth. There are thoſe whom nothing will quiet, Some men will not be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vinced though we ſhould bring them beams of light. However I ſhall not mention any other Objections which men are wont to bring for their excuſe: Not that I have named all that might be found, but be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe I have named the more general and material. Nor do I know any other that are worth the naming. I pray God grant that we may not refuſe the Truth where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever we find it. We are in a very miſera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble condition, if we ſuffer our ſelves to be ſwayed by our prejudices, rather than
<pb n="229" facs="tcp:59207:123"/>guided by the truth: If we ſhall withſtand the cleareſt evidence, becauſe it ſtands not with our occaſions. It will well become us in the fear of God (who will not be mocked) narrowly to ſearch into our Hearts and Conſciences. If we love the truth we may find it. God will ſearch us ere it be long; it will then appear whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther or no we have done our utmoſt to be rightly informed. We ſhall then find it had been much better to have done our Lords will, than to have diſputed wittily. All our diſguiſes muſt then be pulled off, and we ſhall be judged then by the unerr<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Law of God. The good God awa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken us to a ſerious diligence about our Souls, and lead us at once into the paths of Peace and Truth. We ſhall have an heavy account to make, if upon light and inſufficient grounds we ſeparate from our brother, and omit ſo excellent a ſervice as our dying Lord hath required of us. And ſurely thoſe grounds muſt be very light, which have no more weight than the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tences above-named.

               <p>FRom what hath been ſaid before, we may ſee how much we do amiſs, if we altogether neglect ſo excellent a ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice as this, or if we do it not as frequent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly as we can: For he that does it but ſel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom, when he hath the opportunities of doing it frequently, is reprovable as well as he that does omit it quite. And indeed we are ſelf-condemned, if we do omit and let ſlip ſundry of thoſe opportunities which God hath given us; and only make uſe of them ſparingly. For whereas by do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing it at all we do acknowledge it to be our duty to <hi>do this</hi> in remembrance of our Lord, by chuſing to do it but ſeldom, we do avoid the paying our duty to our Lord, and the diſpoſing our ſelves for ſo excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent and holy a ſervice. It is to be feared that ſuch men are not much affected with their Lords death, who decline the often remembrance of it. Were our hearts en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>larged we ſhould be willing to be alwayes
<pb n="231" facs="tcp:59207:124"/>praiſing our deareſt Lord. We are not ſtinted by the Laws of Chriſt to do this, but ſo many times in a year; and we know the firſt Chriſtians did it very frequently; all that we are obliged to in the caſe is that, <hi>as oft as we do it</hi> we ſhould do it in remembrance of Chriſt. We may juſtly ſuſpect our ſelves not much taken with the kindneſs of our Saviour, when we do rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dily neglect ſo excellent an opportunity of keeping up the memory of it. It is a ſign that our hunger is not great when we can eaſily neglect our food that is prepared for us. We are afraid ſure that the intereſt of Religion ſhould prevail too far upon us, when we will not accept every oppor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tunity of becoming better: Certainly if we have taſted that the Lord is gracious, we ſhall be willing to draw nigh to him, and to do it frequently alſo. <hi>It is to be feared</hi> (as one ſays well) <hi>that they who ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver repent till they dye.</hi> If we love our Lord greatly, and have upon our minds a great ſenſe of his kindneſs we ſhall be glad to pay him our acknowledgments of Praiſe and Thankſgiving: But if we do this as ſeldom as we can, it is a ſign that we do it rather out of <hi>fear</hi> than <hi>love,</hi> that
<pb n="232" facs="tcp:59207:125"/>we do it rather becauſe 'tis the <hi>custom</hi> of the <hi>Country,</hi> than becauſe it was the <hi>com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand</hi> of our <hi>dearest Lord.</hi> For it is moſt certain, that if we loved our Saviour much we ſhould delight to remember him fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently. It is ſo I am ſure in all things elſe which we love: We take a pleaſure in remembring our deareſt Friends and Relatives, we frequently mention thoſe things which have given us a pleaſure or profit.</p>
               <p>But doubtleſs we might be perſwaded to do this frequently, if we were once wrought upon to do it an all, and as we ſhould. For the very ſame reaſon that moves the devout Soul to do it once, will alſo move him to do it frequently. And that we who profeſs Chriſtianity ſhould not do it at all, that we ſhould dare to omit ſo plain a precept, is to me one of the ſtrangeſt and moſt unaccountable things.</p>
               <p>Indeed, where men have no mind to do their duty, they are apt to cavil, and diſpute, and make excuſes. Thus do thoſe men do, who had rather <hi>diſpute wittily</hi> than <hi>live well.</hi> We pleaſe our ſelves with little arguments, and great prejudices; and are not only content to neglect our duty, but (which is much worſe) we go
<pb n="233" facs="tcp:59207:125"/>about to juſtifie our neglect. Thus do we ſlide from one error to another.</p>
               <p>But all this while we do but deceive our ſelves and others; God is not mocked. We ſhall be judged hereafter by the un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>erring Law of God. It is not our miſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken Conſcience that ſhall abſolve us, if Gods Law condemn us. We ſhall be judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by what is <hi>written,</hi> and not by what we <hi>ween</hi> and <hi>think</hi> in the caſe. This con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſideration if it had but its due weight with us, would be of great moment to move us to the moſt diligent and impartial ſearch after truth. And then certainly we ſhould not be ſo eaſily prevailed upon by weak arguments, and by the carnal and ſenſual delights of this world, to neglect ſo plain and excellent a duty. Whereas now we have ſome little Objections againſt our du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, or elſe we have our Farms, and Mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chandize, or Yokes of Oxen that hinder us from doing it. I ſhall end all with the words of a late pious and learned Writer upon this occaſion.</p>

<pb n="234" facs="tcp:59207:126"/>your duty, and be loſt to all ſence of rational ſatisfaction, or elſe be ſtrongly inclined (conſidering what hath been ſaid) to take the pains to prepare your ſelves, or rather to keep your ſelves in a conſtant Preparation, for frequent Communion there with our Bleſſed Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viour: An innocent, holy and uſeful life cannot but commend it ſelf to you, if it be but on this ſcore, that you may be entertained with ſuch a comfort as to know the love of God in Chriſt to you; and be fit to be feaſted continually with ſuch delightful pledges of it. How is it poſſible for any conſiderate perſons to deſpiſe or neglect ſuch means of their contentment? The Table of the Lord, methinks, ſhould be more acceptable to them than a Stage; and they ſhould run more greedily to this Divine Feaſt, than they do to the Theatres: He ſhould have more gueſts, and a greater croud to attend upon him than thoſe ſo much frequented places. For what do they ſee repreſented there, but ſome of the follies of Mankind; the paſſions and misfortunes of a miſerable Lover; the wiles and ſubtle contrivances of ſome ingenious perſon; or ſuch like things, ſome of which never were? But here
<pb n="235" facs="tcp:59207:126"/>is repreſented the great wiſdom of Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mighty God; the manifold wiſdom of our Creator, into which the Angels de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſired to look, and of which they are gladſom Spectators: The incomparable kindneſs of our Bleſſed Saviour; that ardent love which offered him up to God upon the Croſs, and which he ſtill continues now that he is in the Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vens; as we ſee by theſe remembrances which he hath left us of it: The rare method of our Salvation: The won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derful way which Heaven hath contri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved to bring loſt Souls again thither; the glorious conqueſt which the Savi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>our of the World hath made over Sin, the Grave and Hell; all which we here behold, his Captives, and our ſelves the prize which he deſires to win, by all his labours. Do not men then extreamly betray their infidelity? is it not plain that Chriſtian piety lies languiſhing and dying; when ſuch numbers will ſpend a great deal of time to prepare and dreſs themſelves to be ſeen in the Theater, and we cannot prevail in ſome places, with any conſiderable company to meet us at this glorious repreſentation, which we make at the Table of the Lord? They that will be at the pains to go to
<pb n="236" facs="tcp:59207:127"/>the former every day, content them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves, nay think it a great trouble, to put their Souls into a poſture to come to this holy place once in a whole year. And God knows how many there are, that will not put themſelves to that pains neither: who rarely appear before God at this Holy Solemnity, and whoſe faces are ſcarce ever ſeen in the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſence of our Saviour, O ſhameful in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gratitude! which you that read theſe things, if you are believers, can never endure. I think to be guilty of. If you give any credit to this Hiſtory of the love of God in Chriſt Jeſus, recorded in the Goſpel, you will ſpend ſome time ſure to diſpoſe your ſelves to make fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quent acknowledgments to him, by re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiving theſe holy Myſteries. You will be aſhamed that ſo much time ſhould be conſumed in triming up your ſelves to ſee, and to be ſeen in other places; and little or none that you may come before God, and behold the great things that he hath done for your Souls. For the love of God conſider at what charge he hath furniſhed this Table for you; how often he hath invited you to it; how deſirous he is that you would ſhew him ſo much love, as not to refuſe him your
<pb n="237" facs="tcp:59207:127"/>company there. Think how ill he muſt needs take it, if you will not accept of his ſingular kindneſs; nay, that you your ſelves will not be pleaſed, when you reflect and conſider, of how much joy you have deprived your Souls, by denying him ſo much of your duty. For there is no compare between all the jollities in the world, and this one ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gle pleaſure, of giving hearty thanks to God, for his unſpeakable mercy to us in Chriſt Jeſus. Do but come and ſee. Satisfie your ſelves by waiting on him at his Table, with ſuch thoughts as be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come his preſence. If you have the leaſt ſpark of goodneſs; you will find it ſhine and glow, and ſpread it ſelf to your infinite joy and contentment of heart. Among all the various degrees and conditions of Chriſtian people, there will none be found that come hi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther with ſincere affection to do this in remembrance of their Saviour, but may go away rejoycing, loaded with many Divine benefits.</q>

            <p>O Moſt Glorious, and for ever Bleſſed Lord God, Thou art and there is none like unto thee in Heaven or in Earth; thy Wiſdom is infinite, thy Power irreſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtible, and thou art of purer eyes than to behold the leaſt iniquity with approbation. It is of thy unſpeakable Mercy that I am not long ago conſumed.</p>
            <p>I bluſh and am aſhamed when <hi>I</hi> lift up my eyes unto thy Divine Majeſty: I do in all humble reverence proſtrate my ſelf be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore thee, and implore thy gracious fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour in the name and Mediation of Jeſus Chriſt the Righteous, who ever lives to make interceſſion for thoſe who come un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to God by him.</p>
            <p>I do acknowledge thy many mercies to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards me. <hi>I</hi> received my being and my breath from thee: I have ever ſince <hi>I</hi> came into being been ſuſtained by thee. Thou haſt preſerved mine eyes from tears, my feet from falling, and my Soul from death. My Life and Health, my Liberty, and all the comforts of my life are intirely owing to thy gracious goodneſs and bounty.</p>
            <p>But above all thou art to be acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledged for thine ineſtimable Love in the
<pb n="241" facs="tcp:59207:129"/>Redemption of the World by our Lord Jeſus Chriſt, for the means of Grace, and hope of Glory. Thou haſt given thy Son to dye for me, revealed thy gentle and holy Laws to direct and guide me, pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſed thy Spirit to aſſiſt me, propounded Eternal Life to encourage my endeavours. I have been received into thy Church by Baptiſm, and promiſed and profeſſed obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience to thy holy Laws.</p>
            <p>But notwithſtanding all theſe obligati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons to ſincere and univerſal obedience, I have many wayes offended againſt thy Divine Majeſty. I have not honoured thee as my Creator, nor loved thee as my Father, nor obeyed thee as my Soveraign Lord and Maſter. And whereas I have been very ſenſible of the kindneſs ſhewed my by my fellow Creatures, I have had but very little ſenſe of the innumerable and underſerved favours which thou haſt heap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed upon me from time to time.</p>
            <p>I have ſinned againſt thee in thought, word, and deed: I have ſinned greatly and deſerve the death which by my wick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>edneſs I have purſued — I am guilty after the cleareſt <hi>light</hi> and knowledge;<note place="margin">Here make a particular confeſſion of ſin.</note> after the moſt <hi>indearing mercies</hi> and favours; after the moſt <hi>ſolemn

            <p>O Lord look down from heaven with an eye of pity and compaſſion upon me a wretched ſinner: <hi>I</hi> am leſs then the leaſt of thy mercies, and am vile in my own eyes: I beg thy pardon and forgiveneſs for Chriſt his ſake, who came into the World to ſeek and ſave that which was loſt.</p>
            <p>In a deep ſenſe of the wickedneſs of my former life, and the hainous nature of my offences I approach unto thy Divine Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jeſty with full purpoſe of amendment of Life: I truſt in thy mercy, O Lord, through Chriſt Jeſus; and do with all poſſible thankfulneſs keep in memory his precious death. And being very ſenſible how much <hi>I</hi> ſtand in need of thy mercy and forgive<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of all my ſins, and the circumſtances of aggravation, which have attended them, <hi>I</hi> do declare that I do forgive all my Ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies,
<pb n="243" facs="tcp:59207:130"/>and that <hi>I</hi> come before thee with ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cere and univerſal Charity to all mankind.</p>
            <p>Search me O Lord; and try my heart, and lead me into the way Everlaſting.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>I</hi> am coming to thy Holy Table to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>new the Covenant with thee which <hi>I</hi> have broken. <hi>I</hi> am unworthy of the Crumbs which fall from thence. But moſt gracious Lord look upon me in Chriſt Jeſus. Help me that <hi>I</hi> may attend upon thee without diſtraction. Work in me all thoſe holy and heavenly diſpoſitions which may ren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der me fit for this ſervice. Grant that <hi>I</hi> may come before thee with lowly thoughts of my ſelf, and the moſt raiſed apprehenſions of thy love in Chriſt Jeſus; ſtrengthen my weak Faith, perfect my Repentance, confirm my reſolutions of amendment, and enlarge my Charity; grant that I may receive Chriſt Jeſus my Lord, and that <hi>I</hi> may walk in him: That <hi>I</hi> may partake of the benefits of his death, and of the fruits of his interceſſion at thy right hand.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>I</hi> moſt humbly beſeech thee not only to pardon all my paſt ſins, and to ſpeak peace to my Soul, but that thou wouldeſt renew my nature and write thy laws upon my heart. Englighten my dark mind, rectifie my crooked will, ſanctifie my depraved
<pb n="244" facs="tcp:59207:131"/>affections, and purifie all the thoughts and intentions of my Heart, and grant that for the time to come <hi>I</hi> may forſake every evil way and purifie my ſelf as thou art pure.</p>
            <p>Keep me, O Lord, for the time to come from every thing that is hurtful to me, and diſpleaſing to thee. From the exceſſes both of care, and fear; from ſnares and great perplexities; from carnal deſires and bru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſh inclinations; from covetouſneſs and hatred, from envy and pride, from vani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty and diſſimulation; murmuring and diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>content. And make me ſtedfaſt in juſtice and charity, in humility, and meekneſs; in purity of heart and heavenly minded<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, and ſincere devotion.</p>
            <p>And to theſe Holy ends vouch ſafe me the preſence of thy Spirit, and power of thy grace, and endue me with heavenly Wiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom, and all this <hi>I</hi> beg for the ſake and in the Mediation of Jeſus Chriſt.</p>

            <p>MOſt gratious and merciful Lord God, from whom deſcendeth every good and perfect gift, and our moſt merciful Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther in Jeſus Chriſt; we offer up to thy Divine Majeſty our unfeigned Praiſe and Thankſgiving for all thy mercies towards us. Thou didſt make us at firſt, and haſt ever ſince ſuſtained the work of thine own hands: Thou haſt given us thy Son to dye for us, and haſt admitted us into thy Church, and given us aſſurance of pardon upon our Repentance and ſincere obedience of thy holy precepts. Thou art pleaſed to lengthen out to us the time of Repentance, and to move us to it by thy word, and by thy Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit, by thy mercies and thy judgments.</p>
            <p>Out of a deep ſenſe of thy mercies, and our own unworthineſs, we appear before thee at this time: We are aſhamed of our vile ingratitude: We have ſinned, O Lord, and done very wickedly: Be mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciful unto us, O Lord, and pardon us for Jeſus Chriſt his ſake.</p>
            <p>Inſtruct us, O Lord, in all the particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lars of our duty, and give us true wiſdom, who haſt promiſed to give wiſdom, and up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>braideſt not. Be with us under every Try<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al
<pb n="25" facs="tcp:59207:136"/>and temptation, and ſuffer us not to be tempted above what we ſhall be able.</p>
            <p>Take care we pray thee of our affairs, and more and more direct us into thy truth. Defend us againſt all our Enemies, but eſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pecially againſt our ſpiritual ones. Suffer us not to be drawn away from thee by the blandiſhments of the world, by carnal de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſires, the cunning of the Devil, or the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceitfulneſs of ſin.</p>
            <p>Work in us thy good will and pleaſure, and diſcharge our minds of all things that are diſpleaſing to thee, of all ill will and diſcontent, wrath and bitterneſs, pride and vain conceits of our ſelves, and render us charitable, holy, pure in heart, patient and Heavenly minded.</p>
            <p>Be with us at the hour of death, diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe us for it, and deliver us from the ſla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viſh fear of it, and make us all willing and fit to dye, when ever thou ſhalt call us hence.</p>
            <p>Bleſs, O Lord, all the race of Mankind; let the world be filled with the knowledge of thee, and thy Son Chriſt, as the waters cover the Sea. Be gracious to thy whole Church, and eſpecially to that part of it, planted in theſe Kingdoms.</p>
            <p>Bleſs the Kings Majeſty, and let his Crown flouriſh upon his Head, and let no
<pb n="256" facs="tcp:59207:137"/>weapon formed againſt him proſper: Bleſs all his Relations, and teach his Senators wiſdom: And bleſs all that are to govern and teach thy Church, make them ſucceſs<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful in their labours, and grant they may conſider the account they muſt one day give. Pity the ſick and weak, the poor and needy, the Widowes and Fatherleſs, and all that mourn or are broken in heart. Be merciful unto them according to their ſeveral neceſſities.</p>
            <p>Bleſs our Friends, and grant us Grace to forgive our enemies, as heartily as we do deſire forgiveneſs of thee our Heaven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly Father.</p>
            <p>We pray thee to defend us this night from every thing that is evil, and do more for us than we can ask or think, for Jeſus Chriſt his ſake, in whoſe name and words we continue to Pray,</p>
            <closer>Our Father, &amp;c.</closer>
